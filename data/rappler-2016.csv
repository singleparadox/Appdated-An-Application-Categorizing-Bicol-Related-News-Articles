Duterte in typhoon-hit Bicol: Let's return to normalcy ASAP,"MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte on Tuesday, December 27, visited Catanduanes and Camarines Sur – two provinces in the Bicol Region badly hit by Typhoon Nina (Nock-ten).

In Camarines Sur – a province placed under state of calamity on Monday morning, December 26 – Duterte urged the immediate return to normalcy following the typhoon.

""The thing is, after whatever it is, catastrophe, war, sunog, calamity, is really to go back immediately to the normal ways. Huwag na tayong maghintay and wallow in self-pity, nakakaawa tayo. Balik na kaagad kayo kinabukasan. We return to normalcy ASAP, as soon as possible,"" he explained.

(The thing is, after whatever it is, catastrophe, war, fire, calamity, is really to go back immediately to the normal ways. Let's not wait anymore and wallow in self-pity, we're only pitiful. Let's immediately go back to normal tomorrow. We return to normalcy ASAP, as soon as possible.)

Duterte said Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana is already making overall assessments of the situation in typhoon-hit areas.

""Then, nandito po si [Energy] Secretary Al Cusi, so nandito siya because I know 'yung electric ninyo. So ang order ko sa kanya as soon as possible. But give us time...to get things done, pero at least nandito na kami,"" he added, assuring Bicolanos that he and his delegation on Tuesday came to help and “nothing more.""

(Then, Energy Secretary Al Cusi is also here, so he's here because I know your electricity. My order to him is as soon as possible. But give us time…to get things done, but at least we're already here.)

""Wala na akong ibang pinuntahan dito, 'yung aming trabaho lang. Purely trabaho (I did not come here for anything else, only our work. Purely work only),"" the President added.

He also said that at least P50 million will be allotted for agricultural needs post-typhoon.

Earlier, in Catanduanes, Duterte gave a short speech at the provincial capitol, where he said he won't be doing the ceremonial distribution of relief goods. He said it made him feel uneasy, and called the practice political propaganda.

""Ayaw na ayaw ko niyan (I really do not like that),"" he said, referring to the usual practice of government officials giving relief goods to a few people infront of the cameras, before the entire lot is given to the beneficiaries.

He instead told the crowd at the capital Virac, led by local officials, that the national government will immediately provide assistance, with the amount finalized before the New Year.

Typhoon Nina has since weakened into a severe tropical storm after making landfall in the country for a total of 8 times. Its first two landfalls happened in Bato, Catanduanes and Sagñay, Camarines Sur on Christmas Day.

The typhoon left at least 6 people dead and 19 others missing.",27/12/2016,https://www.rappler.com/nation/156785-duterte-typhoon-hit-bicol-return-normalcy-asap
"Typhoon Nina leaves at least 6 dead, 19 missing","MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Typhoon Nina (Nock-ten) left at least 6 people dead and 19 others missing, the government said in an update on Tuesday, December 27.

In the worst incident, the MV Starlight Atlantic ferry sank off the coastal province of Batangas, killing one and leaving 19 crewmen missing, according to the Philippine Coast Guard.

Raul Belesario, commander of Coast Guard Station Batangas, identified the lone casualty as 21-year-old Lyka Banaynal, who was washed ashore in San Isidro, Batangas.

“Our personnel are still conducting search and rescue in the waters off Maricaban Island and in the vicinity nearby,” he said on Tuesday. “Our station is looking for any floating bodies within the area.”

Five others were killed by floods and falling objects knocked down when the storm hit.

In Albay, 3 people were reported dead, according to a Monday, December 25 report. The casualties were Espelita Begas Marilad, 57, who was hit by the fallen concrete wall inside her home at the height of the typhoon; and couple Antonio Calingacion, 73, and Teresita Calingacion, 70, who were found dead in Viga River. All 3 were residents of Polangui town.

“We’ve done everything to protect our people from Nina’s wrath but the incident is beyond our control,"" said Albay Governor Al Francis Bichara on Monday. ""We evacuated hundreds of thousands people before the typhoon strikes for their safety with complete food provision.""

Catanduanes Governor Joseph Cua, in a phone interview, said that there was one reported casualty and dozens wounded in his province. Various roads were not passable due to landslides but clearing operation are currently being done by the Department of Public Works and Highways.

Cua said his office could not provide more details yet on the person who died.

Another casualty from the typhoon was also not yet identified.

Damaged plantations

“Government and private properties were destroyed specifically houses made of light materials were totally trampled to the ground as Nina unleashed its fury on Christmas Day,” said Bernardo Rafaelito Alejandro, regional Office of Civil Defense (OCD) and director of the Regional Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (RDRRMC).

Alejandro and other regional disaster officials immediately flew to Catanduanes via Philippine Air Force helicopters to assess the impact of the typhoon.

Alejandro said coconut plantations in Catanduanes were totally destroyed. “Coconut plantations are totally damaged and numerous families left homeless on Christmas Day,” he said.

Catanduanes, which is under a state of calamity, remained without electricity.

Cua, who was in Manila when the typhoon hit his province, said he is directly working with officials from the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC). Following Cua’s request, the NDRRMC committed 4 C-130 planes packed with relief good intended for the province's typhoon victims. One of them left Cebu for Catanduanes Monday afternoon.

Sad Christmas

In the city of Ligao in Albay, many streets and farms were in ankle-deep water while some homes remained caked in mud left by flooding.

Masseuse Erna Angela Pintor, 20, said she and her family spent a sleepless Christmas in fear as the strong winds ripped off part of their roof.

Their neighbors living near the river bank sought refuge in their home as the waters rose to their chests, she recalled, though her own family was luckier.

""The floods (last night) only reached to our knees. Thank goodness the current wasn't that strong,"" she told Agence France-Presse.

""This was supposed to be a celebration but we cannot celebrate. This is a sad Christmas for us. No one (in the family) died but a lot of our neighbors' homes were washed away.""

Now over West PH Sea

More than 383,000 people have fled their homes while over 80 domestic and international flights have been cancelled, the OCD said, as the unusually late typhoon marred Christmas celebrations in the largely Christian nation.

The government weather bureau PAGASA said that as of 2pm local time, Nina is moving northwest at 20 kilometers per hour and is now off to the West Philippine Sea. It is expected to exit the Philippine Area of Responsibility by Wednesday, December 28.

Robredo thanks Duterte for 'reassurance' of full term,"MANILA, Philippines – Vice President Leni Robredo has thanked President Rodrigo Duterte for the ""reassurance"" that she will be able to serve her full term.

“Thank you. I would like to see it as a reassurance,” Robredo said at a forum hosted by the Philippine Daily Inquirer on Thursday, December 8.

Robredo was asked about Duterte's pronouncement to her fellow Bicolanos that day, denying an alleged administration-supported plot to dislodge her from the vice presidency.

Duterte said this in a chance interview with reporters after the groundbreaking ceremony of the Bicol International Airport in Daraga, Albay. Robredo was born in Naga, Camarines Sur, a province in the Bicol region.

""I will assure Leni and the rest of the Bicol region that you will have her until the very end of her term,"" stressed the President, breaking his silence on Robredo's resignation from the Cabinet. He was asked about Robredo's concern about an alleged plot to unseat her in favor of former senator Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr, a friend of the President.

Robredo resigned as the chairperson of Housing and Urban Development Council (HUDCC) last Monday after receiving a text message from Cabinet Secretary Leoncio Evasco Jr that ordered her to ""desist"" attending all Cabinet meetings.

In her statement on Sunday, Robredo mentioned that she has ""long been warned"" of a plot to steal the vice presidency that she had initially chosen to ignore. But ""events of recent days indicate that the plot is now being set into motion.""

Duterte and Palace officials have said that Robredo's exclusion from the meeting was due to her ""irreconcilable differences"" with the President's policies and not due to political reasons.",08/12/2016,https://www.rappler.com/nation/154961-robredo-thanks-duterte-reassurance-full-term
PNP on lookout for more shabu labs in Bicol,"CATANDUANES, Philippines – Following the discovery of a big drugs laboratory in the island province of Catanduanes on Saturday evening, November 26, the Philippine National Police (PNP) in Bicol is closely watching other provinces in the region for possible clandestine production or distribution of methamphetamine hydrochloride or “shabu.""

Chief Superintendent Melvin Buenafe said on Wednesday, November 30, they did not discount the existence of shabu laboratories in other Bicol provinces after a high-tech shabu lab was uncovered in Barangay Palta Small, Virac, Catanduanes. The laboratory was disguised as a warehouse.

Buenafe said there is an investigation into the involvement of prominent personalities in the operation of the discovered shabu lab. Chinese nationals, he said, could be working with powerful personalities.

The probe is jointly conducted by Bicol's PNP, the Department of Justice (DOJ), and other government agencies.

On Tuesday, members of the DOJ arrived in Catanduanes to work with PNP regional command to check on the state-of-the-art shabu laboratory set up in the middle of a coconut plantation in small village of Virac town here.

""Many agencies are helping us out to go after the perpetrators. The Department of Justice is helping us now for investigation and prosecution of the case,” Buenafe said.

Uncovering the lab

Senior Superintendent Albert Ferro, chief of the PNP’s Anti-Illegal Drugs Group, said the uncovered shabu laboratory was owned by Angelica Balmadrid, common-law wife of lawyer Eric Isidoro.

Isidoro was head of the National Bureau of Investigation's anti-drug unit during th time of justice secretary, now senator, Leila de Lima.

The warehouse is leased to a certain Jason Uy, alias “Paulo Uy,” reportedly a Chinese national. The shabu lab held 6 hydrogenators, 329 kilos of suspected ephedrine hydrochloride, and other materials for making methamphetamine.

Ferro said, “So this could be a very big source of money as big volumes of shabu from 500 to 1000 kilos of shabu could be produced a week.”

The PNP said an increase in electricity bills, ranging from P1,000 to P50,000 monthly was questionable, indicating unusual power consumption of the warehouse that served as a drug laboratory.

Police investigators are also looking over the reported tunnel containing shabu within the area.",01/12/2016,https://www.rappler.com/nation/154141-pnp-bicol-illegal-drugs-laboratories
PH welcomes foreign aid without conditions – DSWD chief,"MANILA, Philippines – Social Welfare Secretary Judy Taguiwalo on Monday, October 24, clarified that the Philippines is still open to receive donations from foreign governments and entities for disaster victims, as long as there are no strings attached.

""We are still ready to accept aid based on our needs and as long as there are no conditions, which means that the donation will be given by foreign groups and other countries are out of their kind hearts,"" she said in Filipino during a press conference in Malacañang.

The secretary of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) made this clarification after posting on her Facebook page that the Philippines does not need foreign aid for the victims of the two most recent typhoons that hit the country since there are enough government funds.

She apologized if her post sounded proud.

""Pasensya na kung ang dating ng komento na 'yun ay kaya na natin ito [na] 'di na natin kailangan ng foreign aid,"" she said. (I am sorry if the comment sounded like we're saying we can do without foreign aid.)

The DSWD, she stressed, is thankful for the pledges of foreign assistance.

450 passengers stranded in Bicol ports due to Lawin,"LEGAZPI CITY, Philippines – About 450 passengers have been stranded in some ports in the Bicol region on Tuesday, October 18, after the Philippine Coast Guard grounded sea vessels in Albay and Catanduanes due to Typhoon Lawin (Haima).
The PCG grounded the vessels after the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) raised Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 1 in Catanduanes as Lawin intensified on Tuesday morning.

Bernardo Rafaelito Alejandro, Office of Civil Defense regional director and Bicol Regional Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council chairman, said 24 rolling cargoes and 5 sea crafts were grounded at the Tabaco City international seaport in Albay, and two vessels at the San Andres seaport in Catanduanes.

Alejandro also warned fishermen in Catanduanes not to venture out to sea as big, strong waves are expected to pound on the high seas as Lawin traverses the island province on Tuesday.

Over a thousand passengers were stranded in the region when Typhoon Karen battered Bicol over the weekend.

Lawmakers want to regulate e-cigarettes,"MANILA, Philippines – Three lawmakers filed a bill seeking to regulate the use of electronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes.
AKO Bicol Representatives Rodel Batocabe, Alfredo Garbin Jr, and Christopher Co filed House Bill (HB) Number 3330 or the Vaporized Nicotine Product Regulation Act of 2016. (READ: Can PH regulate its e-cigarette industry?)

E-cigarettes are battery-run devices puffed like regular tobacco cigarettes and emit vapor into the air. The process – called vaping – is done through the vaporization of what is commonly known as e-juice.

The e-juice may or may not contain nicotine, depending on the preference of the user. The e-juice also comes in different flavors. (READ: The unbearable lightness of vaping)

E-cigarettes are meant to be a safer alternative to cigarette smoking because they supposedly do not contain any of the harmful chemicals found in cigarettes.

The lawmakers, however, cited the risks of vaping.

“These vaporized nicotine products used for ‘vaping,’ as millennials so fondly call it, may be safer than conventional smoking but that is not wholly true. These products still carry risk with them, as the technology used may still be defective and the substance used still contains nicotine,” said Batocabe.

He said that e-cigarettes pose the risk of exploding batteries and electrical defects. Some e-juices, added the lawmaker, may contain amounts of harmful substances like formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and other “potentially toxic nanoparticiles from the vaporizing mechanism.”

Under HB 3330, e-cigarette manufacturers would be required to register their products with the Department of Trade and Industry for quality control.

The proposed measure would also order the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to create a new product category to remove e-cigarettes under the health-related devices category. This, Batocabe said, would take away the “rigidity of medicine licensing but with stricter standards than consumer product regulation.”

E-cigarette packaging would also include a warning, saying, “This product may damage your health and is addictive.”

The FDA had expressed concern over the potential health risks of vaping. Then-FDA director Kenneth Hartigan Go said the industry will have to present efficacy papers based on a clinical trial to back up its claims on the benefits of using e-cigarettes.

There is also a lack of scientific consensus on vaping globally, with studies and scientists contradicting each other regarding the safety, benefits, and harms of vaping.

“Health claims, such as reduced exposure to disease and reduced risk, can only be made subject to the approval of the FDA and based on scientifically validated tests. This will prevent the assertion of misleading claims to the public,” said Batocabe, Garbin, and Co in their explanatory note.",03/09/2016,https://www.rappler.com/nation/144982-lawmakers-regulate-electronic-cigarettes
Ligao City's female police chief is 'top performer' in Bicol anti-drug campaign,"LIGAO CITY, Philippines – This city in Albay province, under the watch of Police Superintendent Lea Supelana, is the top performer for Oplan TokHang in the Bicol Region.

Oplan TokHang, a campaign of the Philippine National Police (PNP), involves literally knocking on the doors of suspected drug pushers and users and asking them to surrender. ""TokHang"" comes from the words ""toktok"" and ""hangyo"" – Visayan words for ""knock"" and ""request.""

Supelana has been assigned to Ligao City since January this year as its police chief. From July 1 to August 27 alone, at least 1,523 have surrendered in Ligao City as part of Oplan TokHang.

Supelana said the youngest drug user in their city is 17 years old, while the oldest is 80 years old.

""Most of the drug users here are out-of-school youth... that's why we are focusing on students not to be lured by illegal drugs,"" she explained.

PNP Bicol regional spokesperson Senior Inspector Maria Luisa Calubaquib said Supelana is the top performer in the region for Oplan TokHang.

""She bested even her male counterparts in an anti-drug campaign, with [a] high number of surrenderees,” Calubaquib said.

According to PNP Bicol regional director Chief Superintendent Melvin Buenafe, roughly 36% of Bicol is affected by illegal drugs. This is equivalent to 1,251 barangays out of 3,498 in the region.

From July 1 to August 23, more than 42,000 people involved in illegal drugs surrendered to police stations across Bicol.

Among the region's 6 provinces, Camarines Sur and Albay have the highest number of surrenderees. Camarines Sur has 15,383, while Albay has 10,593. The other provinces are Camarines Norte with 5,441; Masbate with 3,243; Sorsogon with 2,073; and Catanduanes with 1,397.

Anti-drug operations in Bicol also resulted in 34 deaths. (READ: 'Nanlaban sila': Duterte's war on drugs)

"Thousands stranded in Bicol, E. Visayas ports due to Carina","MANILA, Philippines –Over 4,000 passengers were stranded in ports in the Bicol region and Eastern Visayas on Saturday, July 30, because of Tropical Storm Carina.

Of the number of stranded passengers, about 3,000 are in Bicol ports.

Bernardo Rafaelito Alejandro, Office of Civil Defense director and Regional Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council chairman in Bicol, said the Operation Center (OpCen) has been reactivated and placed under Blue Alert Status. This means disaster agencies and assets are on standby 24 hours.

“The 6 Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council in 6 provinces of Bicol must be ready at all times and for them to closely monitor the situation, so as to immediately coordinate with our office,” Alejandro said.

On Friday morning, Albay Governor Al Francis Bichara convened all concerned provincial offices and disaster responders in preparation for the weather disturbance.

Bichara also enforced the “no sailing policy” on all types of sea crafts including to ensure public safety, and directed other local officials down to the barangay level to do the same.

Lawmakers push for national ID system to reduce red tape,"Outgoing House Speaker and Quezon City 4th District Representative Feliciano Belmonte Jr authored House Bill (HB) Number 12 or the Filipino Identification System Act. AKO Bicol Representatives Rodel Bacobe and Christopher Co also co-authored a bill with the same title, HB Number 523.

Bills creating a national ID system were filed in the previous 16th Congress. The House of Representatives passed them but they were stuck at the Senate until the end of the session.

The Philippines is one of only 9 countries in the world without a national identification system, according to Belmonte. Under his proposal, the Filipino Identification System will consolidate all government-issued ID systems into one to ""improve government services and limit red tape in government transactions.""

“The national identification card will lower costs, streamline transactions, and provide ease and convenience,” Belmonte said.

Both bills would require all Filipinos residing anywhere in the world to register their personal information into the central system to be managed by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA).

A registered Filipino will be issued a non-transferable Filipino ID card with a number that shall be valid for life.

Filipinos residing or working overseas are to register for their IDs at the nearest Philippine Embassy or consular office in the country where they are staying.

Based on the two House bills, the Filipino ID card would be honored in transactions concerning a person's identity, marital status, birth, and other personal circumstances.

The ID may also be used for applications for passport, driver's license, Social Security System (SSS), Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), PhilHealth, Home Development Mutual Fund (Pag-IBIG), and the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI).

The Filipino ID card may also be used to identify voters, schools, and employees, as well as to avail of senior citizens' benefits. It may also be used for court, prosecutor, and police clearances, and in banking and financial institutions.

Batocabe and Co said the current Unified Multi-purpose ID card for GSIS, SSS, PhilHealth, and Pag-IBIG members serves as an ""excellent"" case study for their proposed Filipino ID card.

“Once enacted into law, all citizens, not only government employees and SSS members but the self-employed, the unemployed, minors, and Filipinos working abroad will be under the coverage of the National ID system,” Batocabe added.

If passed into law, the Filipino Identification System Act would make the following offenses punishable:

Falsifying information in applying for the issuance of a Filipino ID card or procures through fraud
Utilizing the card in an unlawful manner
Any person or establishment refusing to recognize the Filipino ID card of a member
Any public official or employee conniving in the application or issuance of an unauthorized Filipino ID card
Violators shall be punished with a fine of not less than P50,000 but not more P500,000, or an imprisonment of not less than 6 months but not more than two years or both.

Government officials and employees who commit these offenses will be perpetually disqualified from government.",18/07/2016,https://www.rappler.com/nation/140089-house-bills-national-id-system
Bill wants state-run crematories in PH,"MANILA, Philippines – AKO Bicol Representatives Rodel Batocabe, Alfredo Garbin Jr, and Christopher Co are pushing for a bill that would create state-run crematories in every legislative district in the country.

The 3 legislators filed House Bill Number 135 or the “Accessible Crematories Act.”

Under the bill, “secured, clean, and adequately-equipped” crematories in each legislative district would be established and operated mainly by the Department of Social Welfare and Development and other concerned agencies.

Each crematory would have reusable metal coffins that indigent surviving relatives of the deceased may use for a funeral prior to the cremation.

The bill would also provide poor Filipinos with a “socialized fee structure” to help them avail of the cremation services for their deceased loved ones for free.

In their explanatory note, Batocabe, Garbin, and Co said they filed the bill to offer an alternative to the more costly traditional burial rites in the Philippines. (WATCH: The cost of dying in PH)

“With subsidized cremation costs, the government can ensure the affordable and accessible burial services for our people. Suffice it to state, this is a social justice measure wherein the poor and marginalized will also be given equal access to social services even until their deaths,” they said.

“[Based on] 2015 data, a memorial lot costs at least P70,000, with an additional amount of at least P25,000 for the interment, including the casket. In addition, public cemeteries require renewal fees which could lead to disposal of the remains if the surviving family defaults on payment,” added the lawmakers. (READ: Funeral services in numbers)

According to Batocabe, Garbin, and Co, switching to cremation may also decongest cemeteries during All Souls’ Day and All Saints’ Day, when Filipinos usually flock to burial sites to visit their dead relatives.

“Moreover, this measure will also channel the use of our lands to more productive use such as for agricultural, residential and industrial purposes and/or uses,” they said.",09/07/2016,https://www.rappler.com/nation/139157-bill-state-crematories-philippines
"Federalism will not solve corruption, poverty – lawmaker","MANILA, Philippines – Kabayan party-list Representative Harry Roque said on Thursday, July 7, that federalism will not solve the longstanding problems of corruption and poverty in the country.

“Hindi ko po kasi maintindihan kung bakit kinakailangang baguhin ang ating Saligang Batas. Hindi ko po maintindihan kung paano ang federalismo can get past the problem of corruption and poverty,” said Roque at the Usaping Balita Media Forum in Quezon City.

(I don’t understand why we need to change the Constitution. I don’t understand how federalism can get past the problem of corruption and poverty.)

Legislators in the 17th Congress have filed bills and resolutions calling for either a Constitutional Convention or a Constituent Assembly to pave the way for federalism. (READ: Drilon files Con-Con reso to 'review' 1987 Charter)

(READ: Will federalism address PH woes? Pros and cons of making the shift)

The national government will focus on issues with nationwide impact such as foreign policy and defense.

During the campaign season, President Rodrigo Duterte strongly pushed for federalism.

Roque, however, said there could be uneven development among states if federalism pushes through.

“Meron na pong pag-aaral ang dating national treasurer natin sa panahon ni Presidente [Fidel] Ramos kung saan sinimulan ang suhestiyon na ‘to. Tanging 3 region lang daw po ang puwedeng tumayo sa kanilang paa kung magtatayo ng federal system – NCR (National Capital Region), Region 3 and Region 4, yung mga Southern Tagalog region,” he said.

(There was a study by our national treasurer during the term of former president Fidel Ramos where this suggestion began. Only 3 regions can stand on their own feet under a federal system – NCR, Region 3 and Region 4, the Southern Tagalog regions.)

The lawmaker added that changing the form of government will not solve corruption and poverty if their root causes are not addressed.

“Hayaan muna natin ang status quo. Lutasin muna natin ang problema ng kriminalidad, pagkakagutom within the existing form of government,” said Roque.

(Let’s stick to the status quo. Let’s solve the problems of criminality, hunger first within the existing form of government.)

According to Roque, the call for federalism did not come directly from Filipinos as well.

“Ang pinakamalaking problema ng federalismo dito sa ating bansa, walang public clamor for it (The biggest problem for federalism here in the country is that there is no public clamor for it),” said Roque.

“Walang tao na nais magpakamatay dahil gusto nila ng federal form of government. Ito po ay isang initiative na nanggagaling sa taas,” he added.

(No one is willing to die because they want a federal form of government. This is an initiative from the top.)

'Pursue it now'

AKO Bicol party-list Representative Rodel Batocabe, however, supports shifting to federalism.

But he said that if the Duterte administration is serious about charter change, it should be pursued now.

“Simula po sa Pangulong Ramos hanggang sa Pangulong [Benigno] Aquino, laging nagsasabi na papalitan na ang Constitution. Kung gusto talaga natin na baguhin o rebisihan ang ibang mga probisyon sa Constitution, dapat po ngayon na gawin 'yan,” said Batocabe.

(From President Ramos up to President Benigno Aquino III, they kept on saying that they would change the Constitution. If they really want to amend or revise provisions under the Constitution, we should do this now.)

Batocabe said he prefers the mode of Con-Con to be adopted to change the Constitution.

In the meantime, he suggested that government offices be transferred to other parts of the country to stop the concentration of power, wealth, and manpower in “imperial” Manila.

“Ang pinakamadali para maalis po ang konsentrasyon ng mga tao sa Manila ay balikan po natin yung sa GMA (former president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo) administration. May panukala na ang mga opisina ng pamahalaan ay dalhin na po sa mga probinsya,” he said.

(The easiest one I could think of was a proposal during the administration of former president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. There was a proposal to bring government offices to the provinces.)

"Over 1,000 hectares of riceland in Bicol barren due to drought","LEGAZPI CITY, Philippines – Bicol's rice production has been affected by the El Niño phenomenon, as more than 1,000 hectares of riceland have become barren and unproductive due to drought.

Ed Yu, spokesman for the National Irrigation Administration in Bicol, said El Niño badly affected Bicolano farmers's rice production, especially in Albay, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, and Sorsogon.

Among Bicol's 6 provinces, Camarines Sur has the highest amount of farmland affected by El Niño at 610 hectares. Sorsogon has 281 hectares of land affected, while Camarines Norte has 276 hectares affected and Albay has 195 hectares affected.

In total, some 1,362 hectares of land have been affected by El Niño.

Yu said this amounts to at least P93 million lost for the first cropping alone at an estimated 80 bags minimum rice yield per hectare, bringing about a negative impact to both the food production and income of local farmers.

Silvestre B. Bonto, the regional chairman of Bicol Region Confederation of Irrigators Association (BIRCIA) and the chairman of the National Confederation of Irrigators Association of the Philippines (NIA), said the El Niño phenomenon badly affected rice production across the Philippines as half of the country’s riceland turned barren, specifically in the Mindanao region.

Bonto explained, “About 50% to 60% of the country’s rice farm is irrigated while 40% is un-irrigated. Unfortunately haff of the irrigated riceland is waterless to date due to impact of El Niño.""

He added that the government should look into ways to mitigate El Niño, such as by developing an underground water reservoir in water-less regions. In the event of a dry spell, impounded water could be used in low-lying areas for farming through pumping, he said.

To aid Bicolano farmers and mitigate the effect of extreme weather, Bonto said NIA ""has allocated P1.050 billion funds for irrigation in Bicol region to address the water shortage for farming. Our agency initiated rehabilitation and repair of irrigation facilities and structures for the long-term mitigating measures on a yearly basis since 2010.”

As of December 31, 2015, 137,317 hectares have already been provided with irrigation facilities, leaving 102,343 hectares in Bicol without irrigation in Bicol. Currently, this means 57.30% of the 239,660 hectares in Bicol have irrigation facilities to mitigate El Niño.",23/06/2016,https://www.rappler.com/nation/137341-bicol-rice-production-drought
PNP chief: Bicol had 'most peaceful' 2016 elections,"LEGAZPI CITY, Philippines – Philippine National Police (PNP) chief Director General Ricardo Marquez said Bicol region had the ""most peaceful"" 2016 elections in the country.

""Bicol had the most peaceful elections, with a 9.5 grade in a scale of 10,"" he said during his visit at Camp General Simeon A. Ola in Legazpi City for the assessment of the May 9 polls on Thursday, May 19.

The PNP, together with the Armed Forces of the Philippines, deployed about 2,000 troops to thwart election-related violence in the island province of Masbate.

The Commission on Elections (Comelec) earlier identified Masbate as one of the 6 areas of concern, following its history of election-related violence, and the presence of the New People's Army and private armed groups.

But the 2016 polls turned out to be the most peaceful in history, Marquez said, following the strong cooperation of the public and government forces to prevent bloody elections.

""All problems are situation-driven. The problem in Mindanao may not be the same in Bicol….There are vulnerable sectors after elections…so protect the most vulnerable, or people may continue to die,"" he told police officers on Thursday.

The outgoing PNP chief directed his men to continue working with stakeholders, specifically communities, and to be out in the streets at all times to deter crime and keep people safe from lawless elements.

Marquez, who is set to retire in August 2016, had earlier said he would give his courtesy resignation to whoever will win the presidency in the 2016 elections.

The team of president-elect Rodrigo Duterte has already announced who will replace Marquez: Police Chief Superintendent Ronald ""Bato"" Dela Rosa, the former police chief of Davao City. (READ: Duterte's 'Bato': Who is Ronald dela Rosa?)

On Thursday, Marquez awarded police officers for the success of the 2016 elections in the Bicol Region, starting with Bicol Regional Director Chief Superintendent Augusto Marquez, who received the Medalya ng Pambihirang Paglilingkod (PNP Special Service Medal).

The award is for the regional chief's meritorious and invaluable service in the field of police operations as commander of the Regional Task Force Secure and Fair Elections (SAFE) 2016.

His leadership contributed to the prevention and suppression of crimes, and the effective enforcement of laws that resulted to the confiscation of 413 loose firearms, the arrest of 1,046 wanted persons, and the dismantling of 10 private armed groups.

These accomplishments significantly contributed to a high turn-out of voters in the Bicol region, as there was a greater security and a high sense of confidence to exercise the right to vote.

Aside from Marquez, 19 others were awarded on for the success of the 2016 elections in the region.",21/05/2016,https://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/133777-pnp-chief-bicol-peaceful-elections

Marquez was at Camp General Simeon A. Ola in Legazpi City to award police officers for the successful conduct of the 2016 elections in the Bicol region Thursday afternoon, May 19.

""Nothing beats dedication and hard work. Be loyal to the badge you wear. Change is coming; you'll have a new chief PNP in June 30,"" he told police officers in Bicol.

Marquez also urged them to always toe the line whoever the president or the PNP chief may be.

""Whoever the president and chief PNP may be, our work is the same. Just do your job. This might be my last visit to you as chief, so my congratulations to all of you for the job well done,"" he said.

""All of us contributed for peaceful elections. We worked together, and the will of the people prevailed. We have safeguarded the ballots. The honor is not mine alone, but for all of us,"" Marquez added.

Marquez had earlier said he would give his courtesy resignation to the new president, in this case, Rodrigo Duterte.

A day before Marquez's Bicol visit, Duterte's team in Davao City already announced the president-elect's choice for PNP chief: Police Chief Superintendent Ronald ""Bato"" Dela Rosa, former Davao City police chief.

Marquez described Dela Rosa as professional and ""magaling"" (competent). The incoming top cop is a 1986 graduate of of the Philippine Military Academy, leaping over other more senior police generals for the top PNP post.

Duterte's anti-crime plan difficult but feasible

On Thursday, Marquez was asked if Duterte's marching orders to finish off crime and the war against drugs can be done within 3 to 6 months.

The PNP chief told Rappler that this move is feasible, but it would be difficult to speculate, in consideration of the country's slow wheels of justice.

""The PNP will toe the line to prevent crime,"" he said.

""[The proliferation of] drugs is very serious in the country. Sadly, it takes about 10 years to prosecute drug cases in the country. We're seeking the prosecutors for speedy trials, but prosecution is too slow in the country,"" Marquez said.

Under his watch, he said the police confiscated at least 526 kilos of drugs from big-time syndicate groups involving Taiwanese and Chinese nationals.

Marquez admitted that these syndicate groups operate all over the country, with almost all barangays threatened by their illegal operations.

For Marquez, putting them behind bars is made difficult by the slow process of prosecution in the country's local courts.",21/05/2016,https://www.rappler.com/nation/133773-pnp-chief-marquez-bicol-cops-farewell-message

The Comelec is canvassing the votes for the Senate and party-list races. The poll body aims to complete the canvass and proclaim the winners either by Tuesday, May 17, or Thursday, May 19.

A total of 115 party-list organizations participated in the 2016 polls. They are vying for 59 seats allocated for the party list in the House of Representatives. (READ: PH party list: Making it more representative)

The distribution of seats for winning party-list groups is determined by a formula provided by the Supreme Court. They stand to earn 1 to 3 seats in Congress, based on the number of votes each group received.

Bichara could be Duterte’s 'big guy' in Bicol,"LEGAZPI CITY, Philippines – Albay 2nd District Representative Al Francis Bichara, the incoming provincial governor and one of the convenors of ""One Bicol"", could be the regional chairman of PDP-Laban, the party that catapulted president-elect Rodrigo Dutete to the presidency.

Dante Jimenez, convenor of One Bicol and chairman of Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption (VACC), told Rappler that outgoing congressman and governor-elect Bichara is Duterte’s person in command in the Bicol region.

Jimenez visited Bichara in his hotel at Pepperland, where the duo reexamined Duterte’s campaign sorties across the region and discussed matters pertaining to Duterte’s proclamation.

The One Bicol for Duterte 2016 movement was formed to deliver a combined one million votes for the Davao City mayor.

The One Bicol politicians include:

Bichara (formerly with the Nacionalista Party of Manny Villar) who opted to support the candidacy of Duterte despite the invitation from the Liberal Party
Antonio Kho, governor-elect of Masbate
Christopher Co, nominee of Ako Bicol party-list group
Rolando Andaya, reelected representative of Camarines Sur from Lakas-NUCD
Jesus ""Atoy"" Typoco, who ran for governor of Camarines Norte but lost to Edgardo Tallado
Mark Chris Dioneda, who ran for governor of Sorsogon but lost to Robert ""Bobet"" Lee Robrigueza of LP
Jun Verceles, of the Grace Poe group, who ran for congressman of Catanduanes and transferred loyalties to Duterte a few days before election
While reelected governor Tallado of Camarines Norte was affiliated with Poe's candidacy, he secretly helped Duterte’s campaign in his province, providing the vehicle from the Daet aiport, including election paraphernalia and media mileage.

These Bicol politicians showed their strong support for Duterte and his runningmate Senator Alan Peter Cayetano in a rally in Daet and Naga City a few days before elections.

Bichara said that if offered he is willing to accept the post to help Duterte with his programs in the countryside.

One Bicol expects that many local politicians will be jumping ship as early as today. Outgoing governor Joey Salceda changed from yellow to white, Poe’s signature campaign color.

During the proclamation event of the members of the board of canvassers, Salceda wore a blue T-shirt, an indication, according to political observers, that the outgoing governor and incoming second district representative was willing to join Duterte’s camp.

Bichara's plans for Albay

As this developed, Bichara said that he would institute general cleaning and accounting upon his assumption of his gubernatorial post, following reports that outgoing governor Salceda has more than a P1-billion loan that will be left behind.

Bichara said he will resume his initiatives in the past, specifically on agricultural production through an agri-summit.

“We will renew the cacao plantation in the province with inter-cropping for cash craft to help our farmers and for us to be a major supplier in the country and even abroad. I will work and seek the help of my fellow ambassadors to export our cacao product, provide jobs and income to our farmers,” he said.

He added he intends to modernize a soil laboratory to know land classification and identify suitable plants to be planted for agriculture and food production, as well as those able to withstand climate change.

“We will ask assistance and partner with the research and development of the universities in Bicol, specifically Bicol University. We will breed agri products adaptable to our place and not from the national government who make policies for the countryside,” he said.

Bichara said that elections are over and he wishes to reach out to each and everyone of the Albayanos to set aside political differences.

“As your newly-elected governor, I will exert all efforts to bring Albay to a new height of prosperity, promote employment and tourism, maintain peace and order, and improve the quality of life of Albayanos. Our province will continue to be the model for Disaster Risk Management and relief assistance,” he said.

When he was governor from the mid-90s to 2004, Bichara pioneered the zero casualty goal of the government before disaster hits. He said that he can only be a good leader if the Albayanos will rally behind him.

“I have no personal agenda as Governor, except to work for the benefit of Albayanos and promote Albay as the best and safest province to live in, in the Philippines. Together, we will face challenges that will confront us and work for the common good with honesty, integrity and transparency. Good governance in public service will mark my administration as governor of Albay. The best is yet to come with us working together in harmony. Magturuwang kita gabos (Let’s work together),” the incoming governor said. ",14/05/2016,https://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/133046-bichara-duterte-pdp-laban-bicol
From LP to GP to DU30: Salceda willing to help Duterte team,"LEGAZPI CITY, Philippines – Outgoing Albay Governor Joey Salceda, a former ally of the Liberal Party's Manuel Roxas II who switched to Senator Grace Poe in April, said he is ready to work with presumptive president Rodrigo Duterte if tapped.

""I'm willing to help the economic team of President Duterte if need be,"" Salceda said late Tuesday evening, May 10, after his proclamation as Albay 2nd District Representative.

Salceda hailed Duterte's apparent victory, saying that after Poe, the Davao City mayor had been his second choice.

""His winning is a glorious day for the countryside and in Mindanao. He is my number two choice to fulfill Bicolanos' aspirations... to realize our dream to have Bicol International Airport, [an] expressway, and total restoration of the Bicol railway,"" Salceda said.

During a visit to Albay in early March, Duterte had said that he would appoint Salceda as chief of the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) if he is elected president.

""If I'll win the presidency, you'll be the NEDA chief, Joey, because of your extensive experience in economic affairs. You're fit for that post....So let's give the economic [position] to Joey,"" Duterte said in his speech on March 4.

At the time, the mayor's remarks fanned speculations that Salceda would bolt the administration party. The Albay governor did dump Roxas on April 22, but switched not to Duterte, but to Poe.

Duterte and Salceda were both members of the 11th Congress.

Also willing to help Robredo

Meanwhile, Salceda said he is also willing to help Camarines Sur 3rd District Representative Leni Robredo, who holds a very slim lead over Senator Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr in the vice presidential race, based on the partial, unofficial count.

""I'm willing to help her if asked by her. We need direct access to Bicolandia. Leni is a voice for Bicol,"" he said.

The Albay governor also defended Robredo from accusations of poll fraud. (READ: Comelec server hash codes altered, then Robredo votes surged – Marcos camp)

""The poll fraud accusation against her is nothing but a castle in the air. Leni is untainted with any controversy. [She] won in the past election battle in Camarines Sur because of dazzling and impressive support of the people,"" Salceda said.

""It's unfair for our kababayan (fellow Bicolano) and would-be vice president to be accused of cheating,"" he added.

Several of Robredo's opponents are also Bicolanos – senators Francis Escudero and Gregorio Honasan II, both from Sorsogon; Antonio Trillanes IV from Ligao City, Albay; and Alan Peter Cayetano, considered an ""adopted"" Bicolano because his wife, Taguig Mayor Lani Cayetano, is from Tiwi, Albay. (READ: Bicol a 'cradle' of VP candidates)

Escudero, Honasan, Trillanes, and Cayetano have all conceded defeat. With the nail-biting race down to Robredo and Marcos, Escudero said he hoped his fellow candidate from Bicol would win. (READ: 'Escudero supporters switched to Robredo to prevent a Marcos win') ",11/05/2016,https://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/132725-joey-salceda-willing-help-rodrigo-duterte-economic-team
Escudero supporters switched to Robredo to prevent a Marcos win',"""I'm always a student of surveys,"" Escudero told reporters.

""Aral ako pagdating sa mga numero at survey, pero utang ko sa lahat ng sumusuporta sa amin at kay Senator Grace na lumaban, ibigay ang lahat, dahil hindi rin naman siguro tama na tumigil ka sa kalagitnaan ng laban.""

(I'm learned when it comes to numbers and surveys, but I owe it to our supporters and to Senator Grace's supporters to fight, give our all, because I don't think it's right to stop halfway in the fight.)

Early in the campaign, Escudero was the vice presidential front runner based on the surveys. But in March 2016 or less than two months before the elections, Senator Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr edged Escudero out of the top spot.

All surveys released a week before May 9 showed Escudero ranked only 3rd place next to Marcos and Camarines Sur 3rd District Representative Leni Robredo, who were in a statistical tie.

""Nalalaman naman namin mula't mula pa na kulang kami sa resources at makinarya, pero sinikap pa rin namin bigyan ng opsyon at pagkakataon at oportunidad ang ating mga kababayan na makapili at piliin kung sino talaga ang gusto nila,"" Escudero explained.

(We knew from the get-go that we lack the resources and machinery, but we still tried to give our citizens an option and opportunity to choose who they really want.)

Escudero conceded his vice presidential bid early Tuesday. By then, partial, unofficial results already placed him 4th in the race, next to 3rd placer Senator Alan Peter Cayetano.

In his concession speech, Escudero said he hoped that Robredo, his fellow Bicolano, would emerge as the winner of the elections.

'Reformist vote'

But for political analyst Richard Heydarian, what happened was more than just the lack of a political machinery. It had to do, he said, with a strong desire to ""prevent a Marcos return to the office."" (READ: Hairline gap between Robredo, Marcos)

""I think the inclusion of Chiz Escudero kind of helped her,"" Heydarian said on Tuesday, during Rappler's live coverage of the 2016 elections.

""Some people would argue she's unlucky because there were 4 Bicolanos fighting, so the Bicol vote was split the way the Ilocano-Northern Luzon vote was not split. But I think what happened was when Chiz was going down, a lot of Chiz supporters I think switched to Leni because they saw her as the more competitive candidate that could prevent a Marcos return to the office.""

Based on the partial, unofficial results from the Comelec-GMA7 Mirror Server, Robredo currently leads in 5 out of 6 Bicol provinces: Albay, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, Catanduanes, and Masbate.

Escudero dominated in his home province Sorsogon, but only ranked second to Robredo in Albay, Camarines Norte, and Catanduanes. Marcos was the second choice in Camarines Sur and Masbate.

Heydarian said with the perception that ""the return of Marcos is something we have to stop,"" Robredo became the rallying point for the ""reformist vote.""

""She gravitated most likely even votes from Chiz Escudero. A weaker Chiz Escudero was better for Leni and was just good enough for Leni to have edged out Marcos,"" Heydarian explained.

Cayetano, he said, kept it ""strong enough"" to deny Marcos votes from Mindanao and the peripheries.

Tight vice presidential race

Two days after the elections, it's still a tight vice presidential race between Robredo and Marcos. In the partial, unofficial tally, Robredo is ahead by more than 200,000 votes as of 3:58 pm, with 95.55% precincts reporting.



But on Tuesday, the Marcos camp already raised the possibility of dagdag-bawas (point-shaving) in the Comelec unofficial transmission of votes. On the same day, Robredo urged Marcos to stop ""unfair"" allegations of cheating.

Even days before May 9, Marcos had already accused Robredo's ruling Liberal Party of plotting to cheat its way to victory or scheming to oust Rodrigo Duterte if the mayor and Robredo won.

Robredo countered that Marcos was apparently using her to woo Duterte's supporters as she denied the allegation. (READ: LP's 'Plan B'? Duterte ouster if Robredo wins – Marcos)

Aside from Escudero, other vice presidential bets Cayetano, Antonio Trillanes IV, and Gregorio ""Gringo"" Honasan II have already conceded defeat.",11/05/2016,https://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/132697-escudero-supporters-switch-robredo
Ako Bicol leads party-list race; 2 new groups in top 10,"MANILA, Philippines – Party-list group Ako Bicol is currently leading the 2016 party-list election, based on partial and unofficial results from the Comelec's transparency server as of 12:57 pm Wednesday, May 11.

With 95.47% of precincts reporting, Ako Bicol has received 1,633,326 votes or 5.2% of the total party-list votes. It is followed by Gabriela, with 1,335,661 or 4.3%.

Ako Bicol also topped the 2010 party-list polls. In 2013, Ako Bikol ranked 7th, while Gabriela placed 9th.

In the top 10 are 2 new groups, One Patriotic Coalition of Marginalized Nationals (1Pacman) and Kabalikat ng Mamamayan (Kabayan).

1Pacman is currently in 3rd place, with 1,283,680 votes (4.1%). Its first nominee is Michael Odylon “Mikee” Romero, chairman of GlobalPort 900 and team owner of Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) team GlobalPort Batang Pier. (READ: 2016 party-list nominees: Taking a 'shortcut' to Congress?)

Meanwhile, Kabayan ranks 6th, with 805,809 votes (2.6%). Its first nominee is high-profile lawyer Harry Roque, who transitions from lawyering to enacting legislation.

Rounding up the top 10 are reelectionist groups ACT Teachers, Senior Citizens, Agri-Agra na Reporma para sa Magsasaka ng Pilipinas Movement (Agri), Buhay, and Abono, along with returning group Puwersa ng Bayaning Atleta (PBA).

The Senior Citizens partylist won in the 2013 elections, but its nominees have yet to enter the House of Representatives due to pending resolution of their case before the courts.

A total of 59 seats for the partylist are up for grabs in the 17th Congress (2016-19). (READ: PH party list: Making it more representative)

"Vote-buying, VCM glitches mar polls in Bicol, Zambales","“This is the first time that vote-buying took place for presidential candidates here,” remarked reelectionist Albay Third District Representative Fernando Gonzalez of the Liberal Party.

Free transportation and food for voters, and other forms of alleged vote-buying were observed in the First District of Albay where there is a 3-cornered congressional race among comebacking former representative Edcel Lagman (LP), Antonio Betito of the Nationalist People’s Coalition (NPC), and Ted Contacto of PDP-Laban.

In Catanduanes, voters reportedly received P5,000 to nearly P10,000 each, according to a woman who claimed she sold her vote, along with 17 other registered voters in their family. They reportedly earned a total of P90,000 in the 2016 polls.

In Masbate, the Philippine National Police in Bicol said it received reports of political harassment and vote-buying on election day.

A shooting incident was reported in the towns of Milagros and San Pascual while in Cataingan town, the members of the Board of Election Inspectors (BEIs) of Tugbo village requested for police assistance because of tension due to intense political rivalry there.

PNP Bicol spokesperson Police Senior Inspector Malu Calubaquib said there were instances of malfunctioning VCMs throughout the Bicol region.

Parts of the region were also hit by power outages, despite the assurance of the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) that this would not happen on election day. This covered some areas in Albay, Camarines Norte and Camarines Sur.

In Zambales, at least 10 voting precincts in Olongapo City and 4 towns in Zambales province reported malfunctioning VCMs. Poll clerks and election inspectors in precincts where VCM glitches were reported explained that these were minor technical problems and were immediately addressed.

Meanwhile, party leaders of ""Sulong Zambales"" under reelectionist Governor Hermogenes Ebdane were accused of vote-buying by village leaders who asked not to be named.

Supporters of Candelaria mayoralty candidate Gilbert Hermoso claimed to have foiled alleged vote-buying attempts of the town’s reelectionist mayor, reportedly at P2,000 to P3,000 per voter.

In almost all the towns of Zambales from Sta Cruz in the north to Subic in the south in the last few days leading to May 9, candidates and party leaders allegedly openly distributed cash amounting to P500 per voter.

Rappler correspondent Randy Datu saw voters queuing up in the houses of candidates or local coordinators, and managed to talk to some of those coming out. Some admitted that they received the money while others showed the shaded sample ballots in their envelopes.

Amid allegations of massive vote buying by Ebdane’s candidates, his party leaders explained that the money being distributed were allowances of their barangay coordinators and watchers.",09/05/2016,https://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/132449-vote-buying-vcm-glitches-bicol-zambales
Robredo: United Bicol can beat the ‘Solid North’,"NAGA, Philippines – Can a “united Bicol” propel Leni Robredo to the vice presidency?

It was a pitch the Liberal Party's vice presidential bet made during the ruling party’s final provincial rally in Naga City on Thursday, May 5.

“Alam ko sa likod ng isip nyo, nangangamba kayo para sakin. Pero kahit may pangamba kayo, sige lang. Hindi pa rin tayo pinanghinaan ng loob,” Robredo told a massive crowd gathered at the Plaza Quezon in the city.

(I know that you’re still worried for me. But despite those apprehensions, we soldier on. We will not be discouraged.)

Robredo, a first-time lawmaker, leads the vice presidential race alongside longtime politician Senator Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. The latest preference surveys have shown the two in a statistical tie. (READ: Robredo, Marcos in virtual tie)

Speaking in Bicolano, the Naga City native narrative her steady climb in preference surveys. When the LP formally announced Robredo’s candidate, she was hovering between 1% and 4%. The past few months have seen her numbers rise to a high of 30%.

“Bakit ko po ito kinukwento sa inyong lahat? Para ipakita sainyo na ngayon, apat na araw bago ang eleksyon parang ang laban, nasa dalawa na lang na kandidato, isang Bikolano [at] isang Ilokano [Pero] marami ang nangangamba, ‘pano yan kasi may solid north?,” said Robredo, referring to Marcos.

(Why am I telling you this? To show all of you that 4 days before the election, the fight is down to two candidates – a Bicolano and an Ilocano. But many are worried. How will you win when there’s a Solid North?)

Marcos is the only son of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos. The younger Marcos has held several positions in government, from being vice governor and eventually, governor of Ilocos Norte, representing the same province in Congress, until eventually bagging a Senate seat. (READ: Marcos: Only cheating can make me lose on Monday)

The “Solid North” refers to the Ilocos region, which Ilocos Norte belongs to, and nearby provinces. Marcos is banking on the “Solid North” to bag him the country’s second-highest elective post.

“Alam po ninyo ang Ilocos Region, parang 2.3 million ang boto. Alam niyo kung ilang ang Bicol region? 3.4 million votes. Ano ang ibig sabihin? Ang ibig sabihin kung magkakaisa lang ang Bicol, kayang kaya nating talunin ang solid north,” added Robredo, to the applause of her fellow Bicolanos.

(The Ilocos region has around 2.3 million votes. Do you know how many votes the Bicol region has? 3.4 million votes. So what does this mean? This means that if Bicol unites, it can beat the Solid North.)

5 Bicolanos

But it won’t be an easy request.

Robredo is only one of 5 candidates in the vice presidential race who either grew up in or traces their roots to the region. Among the 5, however, it’s only Robredo who’s nearest to Marcos in terms of survey numbers.

Senator Francis Escudero, from the politically influential Escudero clan of Sorsogon, is roughly 10 percentage points away from either Robredo or Marcos.

Manuel Roxas II, Robredo’s standard bearer, made the same pitch for his running mate.

“Hindi niya sasabihin ito, kaya ako ang magsasabi nito. Pakiusap ko sa inyo, kausapin ninyo ang inyong mga kaibigan. Kausapin ninyo ang inyong mga kakilala. Kausapin po ninyo ang inyong mga kapitbahay, ang inyong mga kakilala. Hindi lang dito sa Camarines Sur, dahil dito, buong-buo na solid na solid na para kay Leni Robredo. Ang kailangan natin ay mabuo, maging solid na solid ang buong Bicol para kay Leni Robredo,” said Roxas.

(She won’t say this so let me. I ask of you: talk to you friends, talk to everyone you know. Talk to your neighbors. Not just in Camarines Sur because here you’re solidly for Leni Robredo. But we need to solidify the entire Bicol region for Leni Robredo.)

Roxas said that Marcos has the advantage not only of being the sole Ilocano vice presidential candidate, but also of having the support of voters in Waray-speaking provinces. Marcos' mother, former first lady and current Ilocos Norte representative Imelda Marcos, is from Leyte.

Support for Roxas

Camarines Sur and the rest of the Bicol region will be an interesting battleground for the ruling party.

In Camarines Sur, for instance, politicians of different affiliations have overtly or subtly supported the bid of Robredo. They do, however, support different presidential candidates.

The LP suffered a blow recently when one of its key allies, Albay Governor Joey Salceda, jumped ship to support the candidate of presidential candidate Grace Poe. As if to reject the notion that the ruling party has lost Albay’s support, Roxas and Robredo barnstormed Legazpi City, as part of its Thursday blitz around Bicol.

On Thursday, too, Robredo made a pitch for Roxas, whose numbers in Bicol have dipped recently. According to the latest Manila Standard poll conducted by Laylo Research Strategies, Roxas’ preference numbers in the region have dipped to 23%, from a high of 35%.

It is because of Roxas, Robredo said, that she enjoys high preference ratings in Visayas. The Visayas is considered a bailiwick of Roxas, who traces his roots to Capiz and Negros Occidental.

Robredo called on her fellow Bicolanos to campaign for Roxas and make him the top choice of the region.

“Ito po hindi lang pag-pakita ng utang na loob sa tulong sa akin ngunit pagpapakita lang ng mas malalim na pagintindi. Kung ako suswertihin, mukang suswertihin naman tayo, kung iba ang presidente na mananalo, hindi tayo sigurado kung magiging bwelo ako. Mas mabuti kung si Leni Robredo, Mar Roxas ang presidente,” she said.

(This isn’t just me showing gratitude for the help he’s given me but it comes from a deeper understanding of things. If I’m lucky enough to win, and it looks like I will be lucky, if it’s a different president who wins, I’m not sure if I can fulfill my plans. It’s best that if Leni Robredo wins, it’s Mar Roxas who’s president.)

The Naga City rally is the last provincial trip for the ruling party. It is set to hold its miting de avance in different parts of Metro Manila on Saturday, May 7. ",06/06/2016,https://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/131994-robredo-united-bicol-beat-solid-north
Bicol politicians promise 1M votes for Duterte,"CAMARINES NORTE, Philippines – Several local candidates in Bicol promised on Friday, April 29, to deliver a combined one million votes for presidential bet Rodrigo Duterte via their vehicle, One Bicol for Duterte 2016.

This was announced the same week that other Bicol politicians shifted support from Liberal Party standard-bearer Manuel Roxas II to independent presidential bet Grace Poe, and another reiterated support for Vice President Binay.

The following pledged to support Duterte despite belonging to other parties, some of them abandoning Poe:

Al Francis Bichara, who is running to return as governor of Albay
Antonio Kho, running for governor of Masbate
Atoy Typoco, running for governor of Camarines Norte
Edgardo Tallado, running for reelection as governor of Camarines Norte
Mark Chris Dioneda, running for governor of Sorsogon
Rolando Andaya, running for reelection as congressman of Camarines Sur
Jun Verceles, running for reelection as congressman of Catanduanes
Christopher Co, nominee of AKB party-list group
Duterte held motorcades in Camarines Norte and Camarines Sur, as well as a rally in Daet, Camarines Norte. He told a crowd of thousands that Bicolanos are an honorable race, but Senator Antonio Trillanes IV gave them a bad name.

Trillanes recently accused Duterte of not accurately declaring in his Statement of Assets, Liabilies, and Net Worth his wealth indicated by alleged bank transactions that amounted to billions of pesos.

On April 22, outgoing Albay Governor Joey Salceda formally announced he was abandoning Roxas in favor of Poe.

Four days later, Poe's camp announced that 4 other governors from the region are also for her: Camarines Norte's Tallado, Camarines Sur Governor Migz Villafuerte, Sorsogon Governor Raul Lee, and Catanduanes Governor Cely Wong.

On Thursday, April 28, however, Sorsogon Governor Raul Lee hosted Vice President Jejomar Binay at a luncheon and a rally, promising to deliver the votes for him again like he did in 2010.

On Friday, April 29, Tallado, who was long dismissed from the Liberal Party before supporting Poe, spent for Duterte's sorties, radio hopping, and election paraphernalia. He also provided a vehicle for the survey front-runner. ",30/04/2016,https://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/131265-bicol-politicians-million-votes-rodrigo-duterte
Bongbong Marcos sets foot in Robredo's home region,"MANILA, Philippines – For the first time since the election period started, Senator Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr campaigned in the Bicol region – home to his 5 opponents in the vice presidential race.

Marcos first visited Camarines Norte on Friday, April 29, where he was welcomed by political rivals of the province.

Several mayors and Vice Governor Jonah San Pedro hosted Marcos at the Bagasbas Lighthouse Hotel in the city of Daet.

These leaders are allied with incumbent Governor and reelectionist Edgardo Tallado under the Nationalist People’s Coalition (NPC).

Tallado was kicked out of the Liberal Party in June last year because of a scandal involving his mistress that spread online. He was also suspended by the Ombudsman last October for refusing to reinstate provincial veterinarian Edgardo Gonzales in November despite an order from the Civil Service Commission.

Meanwhile, Nacionalista Party (NP) gubernatorial bet Jesus Typoco organized a rally for Marcos in the city center where he also expressed his support for his party mate.

Marcos tried to woo Bicolanos gathered by dismissing regionalism and the notion of strongholds.

“Ang pagkakaroon ng balwarte ay napakalaking tulong dahil may lugar na makakaasa ka na sumusuporta syo. Pero hindi ako tumatakbo para lamang sa Ilocandia kundi sa buong Pilipinas at ako’y natutuwa na maganda naman ang pagtanggap sa akin sa buong bansa,” Marcos stressed.

(Having a bailiwick is a big help [in running for national office] because there are places where you can be assured of supporters. But I am not running only for Ilocandia but for the whole Philippines. And I am glad that the whole country has received me well.)

Aside from Camarines Norte, Marcos also campaigned in Legazpi, Albay where he was hosted by Representative Al Francis Bichara. Bichara’s name came into political prominence when he became the acting mayor of Ligao City after the 1986 EDSA People Power Revolution, which ousted Marcos’ father and namesake, the late president Ferdinand Marcos.

Senators Francis Escudero, Gringo Honasan, and Antonio Trillanes IV all trace their roots to the Bicol provinces, but it is Camarines Sur Representative Leni Robredo who is believed to own the regional bloc vote. Robredo is the closest contender of poll front-runner Marcos.",29/04/2016,https://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/131251-marcos-campaigns-bicol-robredo
Salceda gone? LP stalwarts vow Roxas-Robredo victory in Bicol,"LEGAZPI CITY, Philippines – While some of their members have shifted support to other candidates and none of the Bicol governors are backing their administration standard-bearer, Liberal Party stalwarts in the region remain confident that they can deliver victory for the LP tandem there.

Reelectionist Albay Third District Representative Fernando Gonzalez made the statement following the decision of Albay Governor Joey Salceda of LP to dump the ruling party's tandem in favor Senator Grace Poe and Senator Francis ""Chiz"" Escudero.

Gonzalez said this would have ""little effect"" on the votes for administration standard-bearer Manuel ""Mar"" Roxas II and his running mate, Leni Robredo, who is Camarines Sur Third District Representative.

He anchored his confidence on the remaining LP stalwarts in the region, as well as the ruling party's strong local candidates who remain loyal to the Roxas-Robredo tandem.

Salceda and the camp of Grace Poe had issued a press releasing saying that she also has the support of Camarines Norte Governor Edgardo Tallado, Camarines Sur Governor Miguel Villafuerte, Sorsogon Governor Raul Lee, and Catanduanes Governor Cely Wong.

Villafuerte is supporting a Poe-Robredo tandem, while Sorsogon Governor Raul Lee is supporting Vice President Jejomar Binay and Escudero, who hails from his province.

Gonzalez pointed out that Lee's wife, Sally, is Roxas' candidate for Sorsogon City mayor, while Lee's son, Bobbit Lee Rodrigueza, is running for governor under the LP. He said Tallado is no longer with the LP.

Strong LP candidates

Gonzalez noted that there are ""strong candidates"" in Camarines Norte who are supporting Roxas. The province's Reyes and Unico families are also helping campaign for the LP standard-bearer, he added.

He said while Salceda's defection to the Poe camp may have an effect, he and other LP leaders in Albay will strive to offset this by working hard to push for the administration tandem, especialls as they do not have strong opponents.

Gonzalez said this is the case in his reelection bid in the 3rd District of Albay, while former representative Edcel C. Lagman is expected to make a comeback in the 1st District of the province.

He added that Legazpi City Mayor Noel E. Rosal remains the leading mayoral candidate in the city. Add to this, he said, the support of LP candidates in Tabaco and Ligao, which have big numbers of voters.

Gonzalez also said that even if some LP members have left the party, there are ""strong candidates"" from other political parties who have joined the ruling party. ",29/04/2016,https://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/131200-lp-members-victory-bicol-roxas-robredo
"Binay’s dream: PH where the poor get free manicure, pedicure","CAMARINES SUR, Philippines – How much does Vice President Jejomar Binay want to lift Filipinos from poverty?

If he is elected president, no Filipino would die of curable diseases, and they will get additional benefits that would even include ""free manicure and pedicure,"" he said at a rally in Sagñay town here on Tuesday night, April 26,

“Under my leadership, no poor Filipino will die because of illness. I want our country [to be rich enough] that even the manicure and pedicure are free, especifically for senior citizens,” he told the crowd in Filipino.

The United Nationalist Alliance standard-bearer faced a crowd of about 6,000 at the Sagñay Sports Complex, telling them of his plans for Bicol region and how he is the ""fittest"" among rivals to become president of the country.

Sagñay, a sleepy coastal town, is a bailiwick of his allies, the Fuentebella clan.

If elected, Binay promised, he would construct an express highway in Del Gallego, Camarines Sur, to shorten travel time to Bicol from Manila, as well build another airport in the region.

“We will create more jobs and irrigation is free. Many of our land are unproductive because we lack of irrigation and water,"" he added.

He also vowed to lower power rates here, the region being a producer of clean and renewable energy that can also supply Metro Manila through the Luzon Grid.

Binay repeated his plans for barangay officials which he had been saying in other provinces as well: to postpone the barangay election set for October, and to provide village officials salaries and automatic membership in Pag-ibig and GSIS.

The Vice President has been campaigning on a platform of improving and widening social services, higher pay for teachers, and tax cuts for those earning P30,000 a month and less.

His critics have questioned how he planned to carry out his promises without new taxes that would ensure continued funding for social programs. (READ: Briones to candidates: How will you fund promised programs?)

Binay attacks 3 rivals

The Vice President told the crowd his oft-repeated criticism of his 3 strongest rivals in the presidential race, sparing only survey tail-ender Miriam Defensor Santiago.

He warned them against a candidate whose “answer to poverty is killing,” obviously referring to Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte, the current front runner in surveys.

“I’m talking to you as a father. We have a moral responsibility to choose the fittest presidential candidate with moral ascendancy. Vote for a president you can be proud of this coming election,” said Binay, who is hounded by moral ascendancy issues himself stemming from corruption allegations when he was Makati mayor.

“This person should not be elected as president. I’m not like this candidate for president whose answer to poverty is killing. Everybody has a right to life. Nakakatakot siya maging presidente (It’s scary to have him as president),” the Vice President added.

Clearly referring to Senator Grace Poe, he reminded voters of the candidate who once renounced her Filipino citizenship.

“She was an American citizen. Now, she is running for president after pledging allegiance to United States,” he said.

Poe had renounced her American citizenship years ago.

Binay also said Poe’s own husband cannot vote for her since he is an American citizen.

Neil Llamanzares, the senator’s husband, has been a dual citizen of the US and the Philippines, but has started the process of renouncing his American citizenship since criticism mounted about the senator’s own citizenship. Mr Llamanzares is a registered voter in San Juan City.

Binay meanwhile said administration candidate Manuel Roxas II was “full of incompetence” when the latter served for many years in government. “He neglected Yolanda victims,” the Vice President said, touching on the biggest controversy that hit Roxas, following slow response and relief in the aftermath of the Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) in Eastern Visayas in 2013.

“I’m the most qualified and fittest for the presidency. I am very competent as I have the longest record in public service,” Binay said.

The Vice President was Makati mayor for a total of 21 years, and had also served as presidential adviser on overseas Filipino workers' concerns and public housing chief until he resigned from the Aquino Cabinet in 2015.

He started out as the front-runner in the presidential race until he was dragged down by the yearlong Senate probe into corruption allegations against him when he was Makati chief. He is now ranked fourth in the latest Social Weather Stations survey, dropping to an all-time low of 14% voter preference from a high of over 30% in January 2016.

Binay started Tuesday his 3-day campaign in the Bicol region, which will also bring him to Sorsogon on Wednesday, and Albay on Thursday.",27/04/2016,https://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/130907-binay-camarines-sur-sortie
Palaro Bicolano brothers play basketball for OFW mom and diabetic dad,"LEGAZPI CITY, Philippines – It’s not every day that we encounter brothers playing at the Palarong Pambansa.

Rufino B. Sablaon III, 14, and his brother John Remo B. Sablaon, 12, of Polangui, Albay are both Palaro basketball players. Ball may be life on the court, but they bear a heavy burder off the court, with their mother working as an Overseas Filipino Worker (OFW) and having to care for their father, who is suffering from diabetes.

They represent Bicol Region in basketball boys secondary and elementary categories, respectively for the 2016 Palarong Pambansa here.

Dreams of playing on a bigger stage, like the Philippine Basketball Association, to help support their siblings and parents is the reason they play.

Their mom, Ma. Cristina B. Bola, has been working as a caregiver in Macau for 4 years now, while their dad, Rufino M. Sablaon Jr., had fallen ill with diabetes after working abroad also as an OFW for 16 years.

Some may think this has led to a life of privilege through their parents sacrifice, but not quite. Mounting bills consumed the family's life savings, splitting the unit up once more.

Basketball to the rescue

Rufino III started playing basketball in a lower meet in 4th grade and first made it to Palaro in the 6th grade. He was offered scholarship grant as a varsity player in Jesus the Loving Shepherd Christian College in Camarines Sur.

Seeing the opportunity to lessen the financial burden of the family, he accepted the offer even if it meant being away from his family on weekdays. He is now an incoming Grade 9 student at the same school.

John Remo, on the other hand, was encouraged to join the Polangui South Central School’s basketball team when he saw his big brother playing at Palaro. He is now an incoming Grade 7 student.

John Remo was also offered the same scholarship at his brother's school but opted to turn it down so he could help take care of his father. He plans to enroll in a public high school just a ride away from their home.

Life’s lessons

Despite the difficulties encountered, the siblings maintain a positive outlook in life. They said that their experiences and basketball have something in common — both taught them important lessons to pull from.

“Sa paglalaro ko ng basketball natutuhan ko na hindi sa lahat ng pagkakataon ay dapat laging panalo. Kailangan din makaranas ng pagkatalo para matuto,” Rufino III shared.

(Basketball taught me that we won't always win. We also have to lose in order to learn.)

John Remo said that playing basketball made him humble.

The two admitted how basketball binds them closer to each other.

“Inspirasyon namin ang aming parents, gusto naming maging proud sila sa amin,” Rufino III concluded. (Our parents are our inspirations. We want them to be proud of us.)",16/04/2016,https://www.rappler.com/sports/specials/palarong-pambansa/129693-bicolano-brothers-basketball-ofw-mom-diabetic-dad-palaro-2016
Bicol DOH releases health report midway through 2016 Palaro,"LEGAZPI CITY, Philippines – The Department of Health Bicol Region reported consultations as of Thursday, April 14, that were done from the billeting areas and playing venues, as well as reports from Albay's provincial hospital during the ongoing 2016 Palarong Pambansa here.

#PHVote: The rise of 'fat dynasties',"NAGA CITY, Philippines - Political dynasties affect the country’s economic growth and development.

This was the key message of Dr Ronald Mendoza, incoming dean of the Ateneo School of Government (ASOG), during a forum on electoral reforms and political dynasties in the Ateneo de Naga University on Wednesday, April 13.

“Political dynasties play a big role in governance because they have the say on the economic policies that we as a country craft and implement,” Mendoza said.

Mendoza cited the experience of Malaysia and Indonesia to show how the Philippines fared in the past decades. From 1960 to present, Malaysia’s gross domestic product (GDP) per capita - or the measure of average income per person in a country - grew 7 times while Indonesia increased 5 times in the same period.

The Philippines, however, slowed down. Based on data, the country’s economy collapsed in 1982 due to then President Ferdinand Marcos’ failed economic policies. It took 20 years before the country reached its GDP per capita in 1982.

“While the economy collapsed during the Marcos period, (it was also the time when) the monopolization of political dynasties started. There is no problem with debt-driven growth if you invest it in business, infrastructure and education. It becomes problematic when the money is not spent on things that will develop the country,” Mendoza noted.

He added: “If you add monopoly of political power and the discretion to distribute power minus accountability, the result is a lot of corruption. The reforms we are doing now are still addressing this problem.”

Mendoza cited the Bataan Nuclear Powerplant as a concrete proof of the mistake of a political dynasty. The country spent $1.88 billion on the project but it never produced even a kilowatt of electricity.

The rise of fat dynasties

According to Mendoza, the post Marcos years resulted in the rise of many mini-dictatorships or fat dynasties, enabling political families to field many of their relatives to run for different positions at the same time.

“Many Filipinos, especially the youth, lost faith in the country because of this phenomenon. They ask why the Philippines still has so many problems despite the 1986 EDSA revolution. But the rise of fat dynasties are the real problem,” Mendoza said.

He added: “The reason why we’re a democracy is because we have a lot of checks and balances between positions. But if one family has monopoly of the political power, it’s so easy to abuse.”

According to data Mendoza presented, 85% of governors in the Philippines are members of political clans. Around 75% of vice governors, 66% of mayors, and 74% of provincial district representatives are also part of political dynasties.

Political dynasties also control most of public finance. Mendoza used the Garcia clan of Cebu as an example. If all their members who are in power are taken into consideration, data show that the clan has control of around P1.95 billion of public funds.

“They are using it now as a business model. This is the power of families at the local level with a lot of discretion and no accountability,” Mendoza said.

The Bicol experience

Rene Gumba, executive director of the Jesse Robredo Center for Good Governance, gave local perspective to the Bicol region’s experience.

Gumba said there is a disconnect between the region’s rich natural resources and the poverty incidence in the provinces.

“Bicol has a high literacy rate, almost close to Metro Manila, compared to other regions. But why is poverty incidence still high? In 2012, there was 32.3% poverty incidence in Bicol,” he said.

Bicol is the 4th poorest region according to the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA). One reason why the region is poor is because it is also a region of political dynasties, Gumba noted.

“Political dynasties are supposed to be illegal based on the 1987 Constitution, specifically on Article 2, Section 26. But the way out for many political dynasties is the provision ""as may be defined by law."" Congress, given that task, hasn’t really created that law to define political dynasties,” Gumba said.

He zoomed into Camarines Sur, which has many clashing political dynasties. Among provinces with many political families, Camarines Sur ranks 12. The province, Gumba added, has been ruled by a governor with the same family name for the past 3 decades – the Villafuerte clan.

“Political families see it as a way of continuing their legacy. They think their family will decline if they don’t field people to run for office. But that’s the problem with that perspective – it’s their family,” Gumba said.

He added: “Regional development is adversely affected by political dynasties. Political dynasties are complex political, economic, cultural phenomena.” (READ: Political realignments start in Robredo’s Camarines Sur)

Political dynasties in Camarines Sur as of the 2013 elections.

While it is important to challenge political dynasties, Gumba said it must be in a reformative way.

“Confronting political dynasties must be anchored on structural and policy reforms. The argument on Charter Change is included here. Then, electoral reforms and party politics – what are we doing to change this?” he said.

Public opinion, electoral reform

Pulse Asia President Ronald Holmes said public opinion of the elections is important in pushing for electoral reforms.

In June 2013, around 65% of Filipinos believe that the elections are more credible since it became computerized. “We hope it would be this high this elections. With a tight presidential race, if there are many Filipinos who don’t believe in the credibility of our elections, we have a big problem,” Holmes said.

As of March 2016, 47% of Filipinos believe the 2016 elections will be clean and credible. Some 24%, however, said they don’t believe the elections will be clean.

On political dynasties, 32% of voters agree that one should not vote for candidates who are part of political dynasties. Around 32% were undecided while 36% said it’s okay to vote for political dynasties.

Holmes encouraged the audience to participate in elections because of its power to change the status quo, “When you vote, it’s more important than protesting because you stop the person who will represent you from being elected.”

Key election agenda

The forum was part of ASOG’s Political Democracy and Reform (PODER) program for the elections.

ASOG Program Director Joy Aceron enumerated 5 issues that the institution believes is key to pushing for good governance – agriculture and fisheries development, bottom-up budgeting, social protection programs (Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program), electoral reforms, and youth empowerment.

“The 2016 elections are critical to strengthening accountability. We should transform these elections into an accountability mechanism if we have spaces for discussion, if we are informed of candidates' platforms and stances on key issues,” Aceron said.

On Tuesday, April 12, candidates running for the province’s 3rd congressional district participated in a debate organized by local church and civil society groups. They had heated discussions on political dynasties, poverty in Camarines Sur, and the pork barrel.",14/04/2016,https://www.rappler.com/move-ph/129360-political-dynasties-economic-growth-bicol
No equipment? No problem for Bicol's 1st gold medalist at Palaro,"LEGAZPI CITY, Philippines – Boulders. Bamboos. Big dreams.

These are the things that student-athlete Daniella Camonoga held on to during tough training sessions. The 13-year-old uses bamboo or wood as an alternative to a javelin. A heavy rock is her substitute for shot put.

""Dinisiplina ko po talaga ang sarili ko kasi gusto ko talaga makakuha ng gold. May mas mataas na pangarap po kasi ako,"" said Camonoga.

(I disciplined myself because I really want to win gold. I have very big dreams.)

All worth it

Her discipline and patience paid off as Camonoga emerged victorious on the national stage, seizing the first-ever gold medal for the Bicol Region in the 2016 Palarong Pambansa on Monday, April 11.

She bested 35 elementary female athletes from 17 other regions and made history for the host region after catapulting the shot put metal to the farthest end.

Camonoga recorded 9.42 meters, followed by Emgiel Duran of Negros Island Region who clinched the silver medal with 9.15, and Cassandra Valerie Hunggo of Western Visayas who registered 9.01 to capture the bronze.

Rizan Jay Irang, the Bicol Region's athletics elementary girls coach, hailed his young ward's performance.

""Tuwang-tuwa ako dahil si Daniella ang kauna-unahang nakakuha [ng gold]. Sana gayahin ito ng ibang team sa Bicol Region,"" Irang said.

(I'm very happy that Daniella won the region's first gold. I hope other teams from the Bicol Region will follow her lead.)

Coming from an underprivileged family, she also has bigger dreams. Camonoga is the 13th among 16 children, and her brothers and sisters help motivate her to do her best.

For those that are pressed for time, there is Sumlang Lake a closer destination in Camalig where visitors can relax through a bamboo raft cruise.

It may not look like much, but with Mt. Mayon in the background, it can be postcard-worthy too.

The lake is near the showroom of Napa Carpet Industries, one of the successful producers of abaca-based products in the province. Try to visit it to see raw materials like abaca and rattan, work-in-progress products, and sample products like those creative chairs and fixture on the raft.

To get there, ride a jeepney bound for Camalig, Polangui or Guinobatan from Legazpi. To get to barangay Quitinday, rent a tricycle (for group) or habal-habal for solo or two travelers. Some tricycle drivers may not know where the showroom is, but if you mention the house of their Brgy. Captain they immediately get it.

Other Bicol destinations are relatively untapped due to their proximity to the main tourist attractions in their area. Destinations in Matnog, Sorsogon are an example.

The Juag Lagoon Marine Sanctuary in Matnog allows visitors to swim with the fish or feed them. This sanctuary is built for the preservation of local marine species and open to public for education and enjoyment.

Snorkeling in the pristine beaches of Matnog can be continued in Subic beach – one of the isolated islands near the sanctuary with pinkish sand. This gets rarely crowded so it's likely you'll have it to yourselves especially if you plan to stay overnight.

There is also an underwater cave in Calintaan Island, a 15-minute boat ride from Subic Beach, which can be accessed only during low tide.

How to get there

Sorsogon can be reached from Legazpi by bus or public van found at the terminal. If you choose the latter, you will have to ride a jeepney bound for Matnog once you reach Sorsogon city. Buses have a direct route to Matnog pier.

From there, you can rent a boat to bring you to the destinations mentioned above. There are huts for rent for both day use and overnight stay in Subic beach. Camping is also allowed.

Surfing in Gubat and Bagasbas

If you prefer more action in your water adventure, the surfing sites in Gubat in Sorsogon and in Bagasbas, Camarines Norte could satisfy your craving. The shallow waters of Gubat make it an ideal surfing site for beginners. Peak surfing season starts from March to October.

You may choose to stay at one of the closed cottages at Lola Sayong Camp or camp in the area. Fees for camping and tent rental apply.

Bagasbas, on the other hand, owes its mightier waves to its closeness to the Pacific Ocean. While it welcomes surfers of any levels, the barrels it provides in the months of July to November make it a haven for local seasoned surfers.

Other extreme water sports like kite surfing and paragliding are also offered here. The hourly rate for surfing lesson is 200 pesos and another 200 pesos for board rentals.

Comfort food, fusion dishes

Get to know cuisines that Bicolanos have embraced either as comfort food or fusion dishes. In Naga, there are restaurants and carinderias where you can sample local favorites for breakfast and merienda and meals for group for all occasions.

Kinalas, the noodle soup of Bicol

Jo de la Trinidad, the blogger behind Naga City Deck and a member of Bicol Bloggers, one of the emerging influential blogs for 2015, shares her insights about Kinalas. According to her, kinalas is every Nagueño's comfort food. All walks of life enjoy this flavorful noodle soup with broth and meat from boiled skinned cow or pig's head, topped with gravy-like sauce.

""Though many offer this dish, Barangay Dayangdang, fondly called DYD by many has by far the most number of ""Kinalasan"" in the city. To date, there are upscale carinderias offering the dish, but the authentic ones can still be found in the humble and simple carinderias on the streets. It can be paired with other local delis like maruya, cheese puto or toasted siopao,"" she adds.

Barbecue restaurant with an artsy flair

While Que Pasa Naga offers only a hint of Bicol flair, it easily finds a place in the heart of locals for its street-forward fares. Its modern take on the Filipino dining concept turo-turo, art-filled walls, and tasteful design, altogether make for an interesting casual dine out in the city.

The restaurant's 7 Portals are particularly eye-catchy. According to Que Pasa, ""each portal serves as a canvas for seven well-curated artists – each a class act – for them to visually interpret works written by Filipino/Spanish literary greats."" Price range from 150-300 pesos.

"Travel guide: Caramoan Islands, 2-day island hopping camping trip","Caramoan Islands, located at the far eastern end of Camarines Sur in Bicol region, has made its name as one of the top destinations in the country thanks to its pristine beach, powdery-white sands, aquamarine waters, and stunning limestone formations. (READ: Head to 'Borawan' and these 5 unspoiled PH beaches)

Buzz about it grew back in 2012 when various franchise of reality show Survivor choose the location as set for its challenges. Paving the way for the place’s tourism growth also give opportunity to the local’s additional source of income for providing homestays, transportation, food, and tours – apart from fishing, that is.

After careful research for itinerary – from getting there, islands to visit, and the possible expenses – our group of 3 decided to challenge ourselves and camped for two days in the islands of Caramoan.

Getting there

Going to Caramoan mainland, there are two options to choose from. First, you can opt to book a flight to Naga City airport in Pili. From there, ride a jeep going to Naga City and another one-hour van ride going to Sabang Port. (READ: German traveler's PH journey: Going off the beaten path)

Trips going to Guijalo Port from Sabang Port start at 5:30am to 2pm. It takes up to one and a half to two hours, depending on the speed of the boat.

You can also take a night trip bus bound for Naga City from Cubao or Pasay terminals. Travel time takes up to 8 hours.

It should be noted that Guijalo Port has been damaged by typhoons, making it a little difficult for big boats to dock in. Smaller boats are waiting for transfers though. It can accommodate up to 3, and that would also depend on the size of your bags.

Note: We noticed that when we asked about the costs, they would always say “bahala na po kayo” or “it’s up to you” – which made it a little difficult on our part as we did not have any idea what to pay.

Alternately, if you opt to take the bus, there are Caramoan-bound buses from Manila. Also, you may take a bus ride going to Naga City then another bus going to Caramoan. The ride going to Caramoan takes up to 4 hours, and it gets a little bumpy so be prepared with some candy or medicine if you get motion sickness.

From Caramoan terminal, you can hire a tricycle driver who can take you to Barangay Paniman. We took the bus going to Naga City, then to Guijalo Port. On our way back, we decided to try the long and bumpy ride in the Naga-bound bus from Caramoan terminal.

Moonlight and gentle shores

We did not seek a tour operator getting there (to cut expenses as we already had general information on the area by reading blogs and travel forums).

When we got into Guijalo Port, we had our names registered, negotiated with a boatman, and quickly went to our first island.

Our first stop was Matukad Island, the nearest off the coast of the Caramoan Peninsula and from Barangay Paniman. We arrived there past lunchtime, and other tourists had already arranged small tables at the campsite.

Aside from the pure sands and stunning rock formations that greeted us, what lends Matukad Island a sense of mystery is its small lagoon, that is believed by some to be enchanted.

Apart from its small lake, one can also climb near the limestone ledge and have a good view of neighboring islands from the top of its cliff.

If you have enough time, you may also hop across the nearby Lahos and Cagbalinad Islands, which are just adjacent to Matukad – if the tides agree, that is. Island hopping on sundown can be a challenge as bigger waves start to engulf the sea.

Later in the afternoon, we found out that we were the only ones who would be on the island overnight. We were thrilled and ecstatic, of course!

We were glad when a local, who is selling buko, left his balsa for us so we have something to put on our food. There was a clearing near the beach shore which served as the camp site.

Our first night was one experience I will never forget. While feasting on our food under the trees, while the gentle waves served as music in the background, the moon appeared from the clouds.

I hadn’t experienced a moonrise before, with the enthralling sight of a sky filled with stars. Magical.

Setting aside the fact that we only had each other that night, we just enjoyed frolicking by the beach, had conversation over gin, chips and liempo leftovers, and took pictures with the starry skies and the midnight blue sea in the background.

Maybe the advantage of being alone in the islands with your friends is that you have the shore all to yourself. However, we know that unfortunate circumstances may happen in the most unexpected ways, so it is better to have the contact details of your boatman with you – or at least, camp there with a number of people.

The morning after, we immediately packed our bags for our second day’s adventure, which took us to the farther side of Caramoan Islands.

It took us about 45 minutes of facing big waves before getting in the paradise called Cotivas Island. What we rented was a small boat good for 3-4 passengers. It was so slim that braving the waves was thrilling, though I did worry that our bags might get wet.

Nipa huts serve as shade under the scorching heat of the sun in Cotivas Island. Photo by Ramir G. Cambiado

Cotivas Island features a long sand bar. It is one of the islands which has nipa huts perfect for lunch time. Entrance fee here is P50 and if you opt to rent a hut, you can pay P100. I suggest you have your own drinks there or you can request your boatman to bring you some ice or additional food at a given price. Some vendors also offer 1.5 liter of softdrinks and ice for about P100.

When we went there, a company was having their teambuilding, proving that this makes a perfect place to hold celebrations. But one need not worry about privacy, as Cotivas Island has a very long sand bar during low tide. You can enjoy this in solitude while the aquamarine waters rush to your feet, the lush green island as your backdrop.

It also has a long stretch of fine white sand beach on both sides and is shaded with coconut trees.

The next island we visited was Lahuy Island – one of the largest in Caramoan. Its famous Manlawi sandbar, which only appears during low tide, for me, was the best.

The one-kilometer long stretch of sand bar also has a number of floating nipa huts you can rent while the afternoon passes you by.

What makes is more stunning is the lush greenery of its mountains. While my friends go on their individual photo walks, I walked barefoot on my own and just savored that feeling of peace and serenity.

Some tourists went frolicking by the seaside, some had their racy photoshoots with the picturesque background, a few couples were holding hands, and a group of tourists was having their selfie moment in their rented nipa hut with their fresh buko juice in hand.

You also have to wait till the afternoon when it’s already high tide so the boat can pass through its rocky seabed. Our boatmen said that it is because the rocks may damage the boat’s propeller.

Our last island, where we also had our second camping night, was Sabitang Laya.

This place is where the Survivors had their immunity challenges.

This triangular-shaped island boasts of two long stretches of beach, and awesome rock formations that remind me of El Nido.

We camped on grassy ground, which had access to both sides of the island’s beach.

For that night, another group of campers were also there but they pitched at the farther end of the island, which was about a kilometer long, so it was still basically the 3 of us again under the starry sky.

We lit our bonfire, cooked the remaining goods we had, and drank some more.

We woke up to a rainy morning after. We knew that our boatmen were fetching us by 8am, so we made the most out of our remaining minutes there. My friend, who is a beach bum himself, jogged his way to the other side of the island. We also plunged into the cold blue waters, and later had coffee while waiting.

First time ponderings

Camping is not the easy romp we imagine it might be in nice pictures.

I had gone on a number of camping trips before in the mountains but setting up by the beach is something different.

Here are some of my tips for first-timers:

1. First aid kit

While you should have a checklist of the basics, a tent, food, and clothes all enough for two days, remember that first aid kits are a must.

While frolicking by the beach one our first night in Matukad Island, I tripped after a huge wave crashed on the shore, leaving my sandy knees bloodied. We had our first aid kit so I was not really worried. I just had to brave the pain of putting alcohol on my wound. Also pack an emergency blanket just in case.

2. Protect your things

Make sure to always zip up your tent when you go by the beach. Aside from taking precautionary measures for your belongings, it also keeps it safe from insects and other animals.

It is inevitable that island hopping comes with its own risks for your belongings, but bringing in a couple of Ziplocs and extra plastic bags can save you a lot of worry.

While you should always be ready with Ziplocs for your gadgets and money, I suggest you also bring a large ground sheet (which you also use for your tent) to cover up your bags while island hopping in case it rains.

3. Leave no trace

And since it is camping for two nights – without any comfort rooms for campers in a remote and virgin island – make sure you manage your human waste well.

Set up a cathole site away from the campsite and from the beach shore, preferably into the woods.

You can also bring an extra gallon or two of clean water for a quick shower. And of course, do not leave trash on the islands.

4. Don’t forget the food

A friend once said that you will never starve if you are backpacking with a girl. I say yes, as I will never let myself go hungry while on an island. I know I will not really enjoy the experience when there is no food. Make sure you pack some fruits, plus have your rice and water secured for two days of camping, and have some bread and some coffee mix on hand. Imagine having your hot coffee in the morning or in the afternoon, with the sun setting or the waves crashing into the shores as your view.

When combined, the tours should be P4,000 (Tour A: P1,500; Tour B: P2,500) but since we went there for two days camping and our boatmen had to return back and forth from Barangay Paniman to fetch us from the islands, we paid an additional P2000.

Better if you are in a bigger group, as you can divide this amongst yourselves and be able to save up.

Camping is thrilling, yes. Be it at the summit or by the sea, when the experience is shared with the people you are comfortable with, the experience will be unforgettable.

Enjoy the island life for two nights, and embrace nature away from the buzzing city crowd and noise. Stay safe and sound always!

Bicol honors female cops as PH marks Women's Month,"LEGAZPI, Philippines – As the country marks National Women's Month, the Philippine National Police (PNP) Regional Office in Bicol paid tribute to its female officers for their contributions to the police force.

In a ceremony at Camp General Simeon A. Ola in this city on Tuesday, March 8 – also International Women's Day – PNP Bicol Deputy Regional Director for Administration Senior Superintendent Romulo Esteban led a ceremony to celebrate the accomplishments of their female cops.

PNP Bicol spokesperson Maria Luisa Calubaquib said that 1,426 or 19% of the region's 7,524-strong police force are women.

Forty-four of the women are police commissioned officers (PCOs), while 1,382 are police non-commissioned officers (PNCOs).

""Several of our PCOs are handling sensitive positions as chief of police in challenging towns. In big cities of Bicol [they] equally stand out with their male counterparts,"" Calubaquib said.

Albay province alone has 5 female police chiefs:

Superintedent Lea Supelana (Ligao)
Superintendent Liane Van De Velde (Tabaco)
Superintendent Paz Magistrado (Daraga)
Senior Inspector Roseleen Vasquez (Malilipot)
Chief Inspector Marianne Fernandez (Pio Duran)
The remote town of Pio Duran is a rebel stronghold, making Fernandez's job even more challenging. Illegal fishing in the Burias Pass is also a major problem.

Two other female cops in the Bicol Region are police chiefs as well:

Senior Inspector Mary Ann Arceo (San Jacinto, Masbate)
Senior Inspector Maria Cecilia Zuñiga (Bato, Camarines Sur)

'They've come a long way'

Dolores Laguilles, a professor from Bicol University and a longtime women's rights advocate, said that women in law enforcement have come a long way despite the barriers that they have to confront both at home and in the workplace.

""To belong to an organization that is predominantly male is difficult. Prejudice still does exist among male colleagues and superiors when [female cops] are perceived as less capable, and [they] deal with some superiors who harbor antiquated notions of gender equality,"" she said.

Laguilles added that female police officers play a critical role in addressing sexual and gender-based violence which disproportionately affect women and children.

""You are admirable on the streets and are credited with employing more effective tactics that have precluded the need for physical altercations. You have a tendency to be more effective in the area of oral and physical communications that compensates for your disadvantages in the area of physical strength,"" she noted.

""Truly, it is a tough job... I give my salute to all the women in law enforcement,"" Laguilles added.

In keeping with the theme of the country's 2016 celebration of National Women's Month, ""Kapakanan ni Juana, Isama sa Agenda!"", Laguilles hopes that the country's next president will address the issues of women in uniform and protect the rights of women across the Philippines.",13/03/2016,https://www.rappler.com/move-ph/125594-pnp-bicol-female-cops-womens-month
"IN PHOTOS: Roxas, Robredo, LP coalition court Albay","ALBAY, Philippines – The ruling Liberal Party (LP) visited the province of Albay on Saturday, February 13, as part of its week-long send-off for its candidates in the 2016 national elections.

Standard-bearer Manuel Roxas II, running mate Camarines Sur Representative Leni Robredo, and several senatorial candidates visited the towns of Tabaco and Ligao for quick sorties, culminating in a grand kick-off at the Albay Astrodome in Legazpi City.

The Albay visit is part of the “Daang Matuwid (Straight Path)” coalition’s Luzon leg. It formally launched its 2016 campaign in Capiz, the home province of Roxas, on February 9, the start of the official campaign period.

Another kick off was held on Friday, February 12, in Naga City, the hometown of Robredo. Her husband, the late Jesse Robredo, was mayor of the city for nearly two decades.

Albay is home to more than 740,000 voters while Camarines Sur has more than one million registered voters for the 2016 elections. Bicol region, where the provinces belong to, is home to more than 5 million registered voters.

When he ran for vice president in 2010, Roxas won by a close margin over rival Jejomar Binay – Roxas got over 244,000 votes while Binay bagged over 222,000 votes.

Speaking in Tabaco, Ligao, and Legazpi, Robredo asked for her fellow Bicolanos' help in both her and Roxas’ campaigns.

"In Bicol, Aquino steps up campaign for Roxas-Robredo","CAMARINES SUR, Philippines – He's every inch their chief campaigner now.

President Benigno Aquino III on Friday, February 12, wore a yellow shirt bearing the Roxas-Robredo names as he led events to court votes for his party coalition that's running in the May 2016 races.

Aquino III and several of his Cabinet members attended the Liberal Party (LP)-led “Daang Matuwid” coalition’s campaign sortie in Iriga City, the second-to-the-last stop in its week-long kick-off for its 2016 campaign.

Aquino, speaking to residents at a jam-packed Iriga gymnasium, praised LP standard-bearer Manuel Roxas II and running mate Camarines Sur 3rd district Representative Leni Robredo while hitting political opponents.

Repeating an earlier pitch he made during the coalition’s launch in Roxas City this week, Aquino said that what others promise, his anointed candidates have already done. “Babalik pa ba tayo sa dati (Will we go back to the past)?” said Aquino in selling the candidates who can supposedly continue the supposed reforms of his administration.

Among those who joined the President were Budget Secretary Florencio Abad, Transportation Secretary Joseph Emilio Abaya, Interior Secretary Mel Sarmiento, Health Secretary Janet Garin, Social Welfare Secretary Dinky Soliman, Public Works Secretary Babes Singson, Presidential Peace Adviser Ging Deles, and Energy Secretary Monsada.

Like Aquino, almost all of them wore yellow shirts with the words “Roxas-Robredo” stitched on the right sleeve.

Abad, Abaya, Sarmiento and Garin are all members of the ruling party – Abad was once its president, Abaya is its acting president, Sarmiento was its secretary-general. Garin was a member of the LP when she was a legislator.

The President earlier attended the inauguration of the widened Pili Diversion Road, perhaps to signal that work came before politics. Aquino did the same when he attended the proclamation rallies for Roxas and Robredo in Capiz and Iloilo, attending the inauguration of new infrastructure projects before campaigning for his chosen bets. (WATCH: In Capiz and Iloilo, Roxas, Robredo hit the ground running)

Aquino described Roxas as a silent worker. Roxas was once Aquino’s transportation chief and later, interior secretary. He drew parallels between himself and Roxas, who he said was the target of unfair attacks.

He also warned against bets who see the vice presidency as a mere stepping stone for the presidency, adding that it’s Robredo who has the skill and sincerity for the second-highest post in the land.

Aquino has long promised to campaign hard for both Roxas and Robredo, who have yet to dominate 2016 preference polls. The latest surveys put Roxas at either 2nd or 3rd while Robredo is at 3rd.

Camarines Sur is a vote-rich province, with over a million registered voters for the 2016 elections. But it is not exactly a stronghold of Roxas. When he ran for vice president in 2010, Roxas won over eventual winner Vice President Jejomar Binay by just over 40,000 votes. (READ: Leni Robredo's appeal to Bicolanos: Support Roxas)

Leni Robredo’s emotional plea to Bicolanos: Support Mar,"CAMARINES SUR, Philippines – Vice presidential bet and Camarines Sur Representative Maria Leonor “Leni” Robredo asked fellow Bicolanos to support the presidential bid of Manuel “Mar” Roxas II, recalling how he has helped their family especially after the sudden death of her husband, former Naga City Mayor Jesse Robredo.

Speaking in the local dialect at a campaign sortie in Iriga City Friday, February 12, Robredo told the crowd that she’s here “not to ask you to help me but to help my partner (Roxas.”

Robredo recalled how Roxas has been a friend to her husband, and how he led efforts in looking for him when his plane crashed off Masbate in August 2012.

The Liberal Party-led coalition is barnstorming Bicol as part of its kick-off to open the campaign season for the May 2016 presidential race. Roxas, Robredo and their senatorial slate spent the first part of the week in the Visayas, particularly in Iloilo and Cadiz, where Roxas comes from.

President Benigno Aquino III has stayed with them on the campaign trail as the administration hopes his presence will boost the ratings of the candidates, who are trailing behind others in the latest surveys.

Alcala wants farming to become 'sexy' again to younger Filipinos,"LEGAZPI CITY, Philippines – To sustain the Philippines' food security in the coming decades, the Department of Agriculture (DA) wants to attract younger Filipinos and encourage them to take up agriculture and farming courses.

“We want to make farming sexy again to younger Filipinos just like Farmville in your Facebook – colorful, sexy and rewarding,” Agriculture Secretary Proceso Alcala said, referring to the popular farming simulation social network game.

The DA chief said that in the past 5 years, the average age of a Filipino farmer is 57 years. But a recent study showed that the average age bracket now ranges from 44 years old to 43 years old and even younger, following the introduction of new technological tools and farm mechanization.

“We’re encouraging the youth to take up agriculture courses because farming nowadays is not as hard as before, with the help of technology and farm mechanization equipment,” Alcala said.

He added that the government's provision of modern farm implements resulted in high rice production over the past 5 years, based on a study of the United States Department of Agriculture. Alcala, however, admitted that the DA failed to achieve its target of 100% rice sufficiency in 2013.

From 81% rice sufficiency in 2010, the Aquino government was able to improve rice production by 97%, or an increase of 18 million metric tons, according to Alcala. (READ: The future of food security)

Modernization needed

The DA chief also said that the Philippine agriculture industry needs to modernize starting 2016 to keep up with the liberalization of agriculture because of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) integration.

The regional integration aims to transform the region into a single market in Asia, where goods, services, investment, skilled labor, and capital move freely in the global market.

“We need to be competitive beginning 2016 to 2017, or else the Philippines will be left behind. That’s why we need to implement modern, mechanized farm technology to adapt and to be competitive in the market with the help of Filipino farmers, specifically the younger generation,” Alcala said.

He also expressed confidence that Filipino farmers ""can be at par with the best farmers of the world"" using new farming technology.

The DA chief visited the provinces of Sorsogon and Albay, where he led the distribution of P45 million worth of farm implements and high value crop seeds, among others, along with Legazpi City Mayor Noel Rosal and Albay Governor Joey Salceda.

The agriculture department has chosen Bicol region as a pilot area for crops that could withstand the impact of climate change.

Alcala noted that Albay is the sole province in the country that has kept up 100% rice stability, despite being battered by natural disasters every year.

Salceda said the introduction of high value seeds and climate resistant variety of palay has allowed annual rice production per hectare to double.

Alcala also said that the Philippines, which achieved 97% rice self-sufficiency last year, is now Asia's fastest rice producer after registering a 4.04% average change improvement in milled rice production from 2010 to 2015.
