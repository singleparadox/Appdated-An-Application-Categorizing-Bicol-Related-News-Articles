Line personnel came from NGCP’s North Luzon, South Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao operations and maintenance groups.

The typhoon toppled 34 towers and damaged 33 transmission lines.

Initially, 100 linemen were deployed but with the extent of damage, NGCP deployed additional linemen last Dec. 26.

The additional linemen included 100 from North Luzon, 120 from South Luzon, 117 from Visayas, and 48 from Mindanao

They are working round the clock to complete restoration before the New Year.

“Apart from the line crews and equipment pre-positioned in the typhoon-affected region as part of our Integrated Disaster Action Plan (IDAP), NGCP also tapped line crews and engineers from other regions, from North Luzon to as far as Mindanao, to expedite restoration.

"‘Nina’ strongest typhoon to hit Bicol in 10 years
","TIWI, ALBAY—The sight along the highway was anything but merry a day after Christmas: Wrecked houses in pools of mud, toppled electric posts and darkness engulfing the town as evening fell.

At least 50 percent of the houses in this town of 50,000 were wrecked by Typhoon “Nina” (international name: Nock-ten) in what Mayor Jaime Villanueva described as the strongest to strike the Bicol region in 10 years.

“We felt a stronger impact than we did when Typhoon ‘Reming’ hit us in 2006,” he said, referring to the howler internationally known as Durian.

Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, who flew to Virac at noon on Tuesday, said the Catanduanes capital was devastated and it would take the province five to 10 years to recover from the destruction of its coconut and abaca plantations.

President Duterte made a quick visit to Virac and Pili in Camarines Sur on Tuesday. He refused to participate in the distribution of relief goods. “That style is rotten, I do not like that,” he said.

But he promised to help the typhoon victims and urged them not to despair. “I hope you would recover your bearing,” he said.

Three more deaths were reported on Tuesday, bringing to eight the number of people killed in the typhoon that lashed the Philippines over the Christmas holidays with winds up to 235 kilometers per hour, the government said.

At least 18 others were reported missing after the MV Starlight Atlantic sank off Batangas on Monday, killing one.

Officials reported that Gregorio Tadeo, 60, was found dead in his house in Polangui, Albay; an 8-year-old boy drowned in Marinduque, and another fatality identified as Iraya Soledad Likdawan was reported in San Teodoro, Oriental Mindoro.

Power outages

Nina took out power in many eastern provinces, with energy officials unsure when electrical services would be restored, said Mina Marasigan, spokesperson for the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council.

“We saw many houses destroyed by the strong winds. Infrastructure like schools and hospitals as well. We are still awaiting the exact figures of how many houses were destroyed, on the exact cost of damage,” Marasigan told reporters.

National Grid Corp. of the Philippines said it had restored nine of the 18 transmission lines downed by the typhoon. It said 10 crews had been mobilized to inspect and assess the damage.

More than 429,000 people were preemptively evacuated from their homes in vulnerable areas, official figures showed.

The typhoon had been expected to bring heavy rains and winds to Metro Manila, but it lost force as it plodded across southern Luzon. Nina had sustained winds of up to 105 kph and gusts of 130 kph when it blew into the South China Sea on Tuesday morning.

Nina was one of the strongest to hit the Philippines since Supertyphoon “Yolanda” (international name: Haiyan) left more than 7,300 people dead or missing and displaced more than 5 million in 2013.

But officials in some provinces found it difficult to convince people to abandon their Christmas celebrations and head for the shelters before the storm hit.

“Some residents just refused to leave their homes even when I warned them that you can face what amounts to a death penalty,” Cedric Daep, a top disaster official in Albay, said by phone.

Tens of thousands of villagers, forced to spend Christmas in crowded and powerless emergency shelters, started to return home on Monday to deal with the damage.

“They have left the evacuation centers and we’re seeing the sun again,” Ann Ongjoco, mayor of the town of Guinobatan in Albay, one of five provinces that lost electricity, said by phone.

Operations at Ninoy Aquino International Airport gradually returned to normal on Tuesday, a day after 364 flights were canceled.
The Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines said some P9 million worth of damage was inflicted on the airports of Virac, Naga and Legazpi.

There is enough supply of milled rice in areas affected by Nina and stocks are ready for distribution “anytime,” according to the National Food Authority (NFA).

NFA officer in charge Tomas R. Escarez said in a statement the agency had well-stocked warehouses nationwide, especially in the regions of Bicol, Calabarzon and Metro Manila.",28/12/2016,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/857300/nina-strongest-typhoon-to-hit-bicol-in-10-years

Albay typhoon deaths blamed on ‘evacuation failure’,"LEGAZPI CITY – It was an “evacuation failure,” Cedric Daep, head of the Albay Public Safety and Emergency Management Office (Apsemo), said after four people were killed during the onslaught of Typhoon “Nina” (international name: Nock-ten) in the province.

“If we had no preparedness, there would be hundreds of casualties. We should blame the community for not evacuating. If they die in evacuation centers, that’s our failure,” he said.

On Saturday, based on a report of Senior Supt. Antonino Cirujales, a 57-year old identified as Espelita Bigas died after being hit by a fallen concrete wall in Balangibang village in Polangui town while a couple identified as Antonio, 73, and Teresita Calingacion, 70, drowned in Viga River of Balinad village of the same town at around 6 a.m. on Dec. 26.

At around 1 p.m., Monday, Gregorio Tadeo, 60, was found dead inside his house in San Roque village in the same town. Initial investigation of police revealed that the victim was hit by a wooden post.

On Monday, 54,053 families or 211,140 persons were decamped after Typhoon Nina left the Bicol region, except for 280 families or 1,012 persons living in Barangay Sta. Cruz of Libon, Albay.

Ian Secillano, head of Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office of Libon, said evacuees were housed in Agos, Elementary School in Polangui, the nearby town of Libon.

Typhoon ‘Nina’ pounds Bicol,"Packing peak winds of 185 kilometers per hour, Typhoon “Nina”  (internationally named Nock-ten after a bird found in Laos) pounded the Bicol region on Sunday night, sending thousands of coastal residents fleeing to evacuation centers, stranding travelers on ports and buses and spoiling Christmas celebrations in endangered regions.

Officials warned 2.5-meter high waves and landslides posed the biggest threats as Nina closed in on the eastern section of Luzon and nearby islands.

“We went around with megaphones and gave instructions to our people to eat breakfast, pack and board the military trucks,” said Alberto Lindo, an official of Alcala, a farming village of 3,300 people near the active Mayon volcano.

“There are large ash deposits on the slopes. Heavy rain can dislodge them and bury our homes in mud,” he said.

Philippine and international weather services said Nina was set to hit Catanduanes on Sunday night before reaching the rest of the main island of Luzon on Monday.

Inquirer reporter Fernan Gianan reported from the Catanduanes capital of Virac that heavy rain was hammering the area and strong winds had felled trees in the city center. “We can see lightning flashes every 10 seconds or so, we must be near the eye of the typhoon,” he said.

The US Joint Typhoon Warning Center has forecast sustained winds of 231 kph and gusts of 278 kph when Nina makes landfall.

The typhoon will affect an area populated by nearly 42 million people, including Metro Manila, which was forecast to be hit on  Monday.

Potluck of relief goods

At midnight on Christmas Day, most evacuees from Barangay Maninila in Guinobatan town in Albay, housed at Guinobatan East Central School, were asleep. There were no songs, no gift-giving and no games, the way they had wanted and planned it to be.

Others who were awake had a simple celebration over a potluck of relief goods.

“Some of the evacuees just slept through Christmas Eve. Each family was given 3 kilos of uncooked pasta noodles and rice at around 7 p.m.,” said Norlito Lebantino, 40. “If we were in Maninila, we would have been a lot merrier because we have a Christmas village socials night there.”

Lebantino was with his seven kids and shared a room with 17 other families.
Officials said the typhoon affected 48,458 families, or 226,168 persons, in Bicol.

Christmas Day exodus,"LEGAZPI CITY—Officials plan to evacuate over 1 million people in the path of Typhoon “Nina” (international name: Nock-Ten) in at least one province in the Bicol region where it was expected to make landfall on Sunday, Christmas Day.

Zero-casualty target

 

“We are targeting zero casualty this time,” Villafuerte told mayors.

By Saturday noon, Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 1 had been hoisted over southern Quezon, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, Catanduanes, Albay, Sorsogon and Masbate including Ticao and Burias Island, and northern Samar, Samar and eastern Samar.

The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa) also expected to raise storm Signal No. 1 over northern Quezon including Polillo Island, Marinduque and Romblon.

Nina is forecast to cross the Bicol region on Sunday night, and by Monday, “it will already be felt in Calabarzon, central Luzon, Metro Manila and parts of Mimaropa (Mindoro, Marinduque, Romblon, Palawan),” said Pagasa forecaster Benison Estareja.

He said Nina could weaken once it makes landfall. “But its impact will still be strong once it gets to southern Luzon and Metro Manila,” he said.

Metro Manila, Bicol, Calabarzon (Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, Quezon), Bulacan, Pampanga, Bataan, Zambales, Marinduque, Oriental and Occidental Mindoro and Northern Samar should expect stormy weather on Sunday and Monday.

The Public Safety Department of Calapan City, capital of Oriental Mindoro, has raised a red alert even if it will not be directly hit by the typhoon, said disaster response coordinator Nelson Aboboto.

Pagasa warned heavy rains may trigger flash floods and landslides in areas along Nina’s path, where strong winds could topple some structures and uproot trees. It also warned possible storm surges of up to 2 meters in coastal areas.
Estareja said sea travel in northern Luzon and the eastern seaboards of central Luzon, southern Luzon and Visayas would be dangerous due to the effects of both the surge of the northeast monsoon and the typhoon.

"‘Tokhang’ for rapists, group urges
","LEGAZPI CITY—Women activists in Bicol are demanding tough measures to stop a surge in cases of violence against women (VAW) in the region, calling on police to carry out its “Oplan Tokhang” (Knock and Plead) against drug suspects on sex offenders as well.

Jenelyn Nagrampa, secretary general of Gabriela Bicol, said President Duterte has no concrete plan to stop VAW cases which have reached alarming levels already.

“If there is ‘Oplan Tokhang’ for drug personalities, why not have ‘Oplan Tokhang’ for rapists, too?” said Nagrampa.

“There is a program on the war on drugs but there’s no concrete plan on violence against women. If we will check the records, rape cases can be considered as alarming,” she said.

Senior Insp. Ma. Luisa Calubaquib, information officer of the regional police office in Bicol, said the region ranked first in number of VAW cases in 2013, prompting police to strengthen the campaign against VAW.

Calubaquib said police are “not just doing the tokhang” but are keeping a list of persons wanted for rape cases.

“The problem with rape cases is, most of the time, we cannot locate the suspects in the area,” she said.

In 2015, the Bicol police recorded 3,467 cases of VAW. From January 2016 to August 2016, at least 2,080 cases of VAW had been recorded in Bicol. At least 105 of these are rape cases.

Calubaquib said the regional police has been coordinating with the Department of Social Welfare and Development, through the department’s Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program which gives police information on households.

Cristita Triunfante, member of the Philippine Commission on Women, said from 82.8 percent, corresponding to 9,021 cases, in 2011, violations of Republic Act No. 9262 or the Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act of 2004 rose to 85.1 percent (28,892 cases) in 2015.

She said nationwide, at least 32,000 VAW cases had been reported in 2015.

Triunfante said the number of cases continued to increase despite efforts to end violence against women.

“We will not stop empowering women, especially those who are poor and uneducated,” she said.

Lawyer Arlene Alangco, director of the Commission on Human Rights in Bicol, said the region’s ranking as highest in terms of VAW cases is no cause for alarm, though.

It just means more victims are coming out in the open, she said.

She said “there is an active advocacy wherein victims are reporting their cases or organizations or agencies are active in submitting reports.”",19/12/2016,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/854624/tokhang-for-rapists-group-urges

Train ride to Bicol ‘bumpy’,"NAGA CITY—It was not a smooth ride for the inspection run of the Philippine National Railways (PNR) train that would ply the Manila-Naga City route by Dec. 15.

The inspection train, made up of three coaches, left the Tutuban station in Manila at 5:15 a.m. on Friday, carrying PNR officials led by Joseline Geronimo, PNR officer in charge. The team had set out to reach Naga City in Camarines Sur province by nightfall Friday.

But it was a slow ride as informal settlers, wet market vendors, trees and sections of houses along the PNR track blocked the route in Laguna province.

Geronimo said the inspection was smooth until the train reached the Mamatid station in Cabuyao City, also in Laguna.

“After Mamatid, there were some interactions, encroachments by informal settlers [near the rail tracks],” Geronimo said.

The train had to stop at some point as PNR personnel remove debris, tree branches and trunks blocking the track or clear canopies of some houses.

In Calamba City, “talipapa” (village wet market) vendors were asked to move out for the train to pass through.

“We’ve fixed this issue (informal settlers) before but they just keep coming back. It’s one of the things we need to ask help from our local governments,” Geronimo said.

“Like in Candelaria (town in Quezon province), nakiraan pa kami (We had to ask permission to pass through). In Los Baños (town in Laguna), the coaches [hit the ground] in some elevated portions,” she said.

The train reached Lucena City at 11:30 a.m., stopping at the abandoned station. The PNR’s safety steel bar at the railroad crossing near the station and warning lights were broken.

The PNR is also checking track conditions and train speed restrictions in some areas.

As of 5 p.m. on Friday, the train was in Tagkawayan town in Quezon. It was expected to reach Ragay town in Camarines Sur at 6:30 p.m.

A portion of the railway bridge in Ragay that connects the villages of Apali and Apad is undergoing repairs, after it collapsed when a flash flood washed out one of its support foundations in March this year.

Geronimo said the inspection team would alight from the coaches in Ragay and transfer to another train to bring them to Naga City.

Ricarte Galopa, PNR security chief, said team members did not note any major safety issue along the route in Laguna and Quezon provinces.

The test run is in preparation for the planned resumption of the Manila to Bicol trips next month.

“After the test run, an assessment meeting will immediately follow to discuss some critical areas along the Manila-Bicol route, particularly the conditions of the bridges,” Geronimo said.

Geronimo said she would invite officials from local governments along the route to help the PNR solve local problems, particularly the clearing of houses along the tracks.",19/11/2016,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/845759/train-ride-to-bicol-bumpy

"Karen at full impact Sunday, threatens Luzon","MANILA — A potential typhoon is on a direct path to hit Luzon this weekend.

The Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) said Tropical Depression Karen, which developed from a low pressure area monitored east of Mindanao, has been moving west northwest towards the Luzon landmass.

It was packing maximum sustained winds of 50 kilometers per hour near the center and gusts of 70 kph, on Thursday, and the cyclone will intensify as it nears the Bicol and Eastern Visayas regions on Friday, October 14.

“By Saturday (October 15), the entire Luzon and Visayas will have rains, especially Bicol, Quezon and Aurora,” PAGASA weather forecaster Benison Estareja said.

The full impact will be felt Sunday as the cyclone is expected to become a full-blown typhoon while it barrels towards northern and central Luzon.

Based on its speed and track, the potential typhoon is forecast to make landfall over northern Quezon and Aurora on Sunday afternoon October 16.

“It is intensifying and it’s possible it will become a typhoon before it makes landfall,” Estareja said.

PAGASA is expected to raise cyclone warning signals on Friday.

Estareja said the typhoon would continue to bring stormy weather on Monday, October 17, particularly over the Ilocos provinces, Zambales, Bataan as well as Metro Manila.

The cyclone is forecast to be out of the Philippine area of responsibility by Monday night.

Bits of Bicol’s past in lawyer’s memoir,"What can make a book authored by a Bicolano lawyer an important read are the historical trivia and dash of idiosyncrasies defining his time a century ago.

“Confidencias Intimas” (Intimate Confidences) shares bits and pieces about the technology, education, politics, culture and the press through the lifetime of its author, lawyer Luis F. General from Naga City, from the late 1890s to the 1960s. It was published by Ateneo de Naga University Press.

Translated to English from its original Spanish manuscript by his great grandson, Jose Luis O. General, and the latter’s daughter, Beatriz G. Umali, the book contains unknown facts that fit into the historical narrative of Bicol, as well as in the different periods the author witnessed.

First phonograph

Awed by the new technology which an American teacher brought into the country in 1901, General remembered the first Edison phonograph being played in his class at a primary school in Ligao town (now city) in Albay province.

“The phonograph had the brand name, His Master’s Voice, and on the brand logo, there was an image of a dog listening intently in front of a phonograph,” General wrote, recalling the music machine brought by Louis McGregor, his American teacher whom the class called “Maestrong Luis” (Teacher Luis).

“How we children gaped in wonder at hearing the voice of a person singing very near, yet without seeing someone actually singing. For us it was truly marvelous,” he said.

General said the phonograph arrived in Ligao at a time when Gen. Simeon Ola, the last Bicolano revolutionary to surrender to the Americans, was “still marauding in the mountains of Guinobatan and Jovellar [towns].”

During his primary school years, General also noted the first automobile in Guinobatan and the only bicycle in Ligao. Commercial travel from Legazpi City to Manila during the early 20th century took two-and-a-half days and only by a steamship, named the Sorsogon.

End of Spanish era

General, a 1923 graduate of National University Law School in Washington, chronicled the end of an era when the Spanish language had to be supplanted by English in the courts, schools and official communications.

Introduced to the world of letters in Spanish through the catón (primary reader), and “Doctrina Cristiana,” a book on Christian doctrine, he lamented the demise of a language he loved and used to express and reason about the world around him.

“Spanish language was the lingua franca in the country at that time (referring to the early American period when he was a student); however what was happening now (in the 1960s, when he was writing the memoir) was the opposite. English not only outshone and laid Spanish aside; it had murdered it,” he said.

Orphaned in his teens, General completed his education through sheer determination and hard work. Throughout his education in Manila, he served and lived with the family of the doctor whom his family owed for the medical service provided his mother.

He worked as stenographer at the Senate and was a close-in staff member of President Manuel L. Quezon during the Commonwealth Period. This closeness to power gave him a front-row seat to witness the dynamics of national politics and the idiosyncrasies of Quezon.

Peñafrancia reminder of Bicol’s liberation,"A highlight of the history of Naga City, a Camarines Sur settlement used to be known as Ciudad de Nueva Caceres, was the revolt against Spanish authorities that freed the natives from colonial rule on Sept. 18, 1898.

The liberation came at an auspicious time, on the feast day of the Our Lady of Peñafrancia, the patroness of the Bicol region.

Professor Danilo Gerona, a Bicol historian, said the revolt began with a rumor that the Spaniards were planning to use guardia civil (civil guards) to kill the principales (educated class). The plot would also include the killing of the civil guards after they accomplished their mission.

Gerona, who authored several books on Bicol history, spent six trips to Spain to research from the manuscript collections of Archivo General de Indias in Seville, and Archivos Franciscano Ibero-Oriental, Museo Naval, Real Academia de la Historia and Bibliotica Nacional de España, all in Madrid.

Blockade

Gerona described that period in Bicol, when the American forces had imposed a blockade in Manila, as peaceful and calm except for the rising prices of prime commodities.

He said the blockade did not have much impact on the region as Spaniards and Bicolanos went on their usual lives without disruption.

Trouble

But trouble began with the arrival of Don Carmelo Navarro, the commander of the civil guards of the Southern Luzon provinces.

Gerona said Navarro, who came from Albay province, conducted a series of meetings with all Spanish residents in preparation for any eventuality as the war with the Americans was turning unfavorable for the Spanish forces.

He said Navarro wanted the Spanish community in Cuidad de Nueva Caceres evacuated at once and join those in Albay. The plan, however, was met with resistance from the Spaniards themselves.

“Natives, who were observing the Spaniards, began to suspect the reasons behind these conferences. With Navarro there, the natives feared that a sinister plot was afoot. Then, rumors spread that the Spaniards were planning to use the civil guards to liquidate the members of the educated class and then the civil guards would in turn be liquidated,” Gerona said.

He said the fear gripping the civil guards heightened when Navarro reviewed the troops and ordered the disarming of volunteers.

“They (civil guards in Naga City) took these circumstances as confirmation of the rumor,” Gerona said.

Revolt

Led by two civil guards—Corporals Elias Angeles (a Tagalog) and Felix Plazo (a Bicolano)—the plot to revolt against the Spaniards in Naga was hatched since they believed it was the only way out of eventual death.

“They convinced all their native comrades of the necessity of this move in order to save themselves from imminent death. On Thursday, Sept. 15, 1898, the civil guards met and planned the details of the uprising, which was fixed on Sunday, Sept. 18, at midnight,” Gerona said.

He said through a woman, the plot was relayed to the natives in the neighboring towns of Naga.

After the Mass on the feast day of the Our Lady of Peñafrancia on Sept. 18, 1898, a parishioner, identified only as Capitana Dibang, informed the priests of the rumor going around the poblacion (town center) that the Spaniards would massacre the natives, Gerona said.

But Spanish authorities were quick to douse the rumors by holding a public announcement around Naga to deny existence of a plot to kill locals, he said.

“When the cathedral clock struck midnight, the first shot of the uprising was fired. This continued until early in the morning. The revolutionaries inflicted heavy casualties on the Spaniards,” Gerona said.
But during the revolt, he said, countless women were raped by hardened criminals who were freed from their cells when the revolt started.

Gerona said some 400 Spaniards and pro-Spanish Filipinos took refuge in San Francisco church to mount their last defense until Sept. 19, 1898.

The revolutionaries, headed by Angeles and Plazo, gave the Spaniards until 2 p.m. to surrender or they will attack and burn the church.

Gerona said representatives of the Spaniards met with the revolutionary leaders and the terms of surrender were presented.

He said the revolutionaries demanded that the Spaniards surrender their arms, issue official communications to the Spanish military in Daet town in Camarines Norte province to prohibit them to enter Nueva Caceres in a hostile manner, and for the governor to hand over his power to rule province to the revolutionaries.

Gerona said the revolutionaries allowed the Spaniards to return to their houses upon the surrender of their firearms.

“The successful revolt in Nueva Caceres, which brought the proud Spanish government to its end in [Camarines Sur], signaled the end of Spanish rule in the whole region,” he said.",15/09/2016,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/815420/penafrancia-reminder-of-bicols-liberation
Bicol troops moved to Lanao for terror war,"MARAWI CITY—The military is pouring more soldiers into Lanao del Sur to bring the war on terror to the doorsteps of an armed group of at least 200 men that had sworn allegiance to the terror network Islamic State (IS).

The latest batch of soldiers to arrive here came from Bicol and is about the size of a battalion. They are now part of the Army’s 103rd Infantry Brigade, which is on the hunt for the Maute Group, composed of armed men who had pledged loyalty to IS.

Maj. Gen. Gerrado Barrientos, head of the 1st Infantry Division, said some of the soldiers would be stationed at Kampo Ranao here, where three other battalions are currently based.

The main assignment of the soldiers is to hunt down and finish off the Maute Group.

At least 1,000 soldiers, backed by armored personnel carriers and howitzers, are now taking part in the campaign to bring down the Maute Group, also known as Al Ansar Al-Khalifa.

Barrientos said more soldiers were arriving as the war on terror escalates in Mindanao.

“If we can’t fix this problem now, it will grow and will affect the next generation,” he said.

Addressing himself to his men, Barrientos asked soldiers to “do your best so that when this place becomes free from lawless elements, you can say that you are part of the solution.”

With more soldiers coming, Barrientos said “sooner or later, this problem would end.”

Lt. Col. Arnel Bautista, 49th IB commander, said his men were ready to do battle with the Maute Group, which was previously unheard of until it went on a kidnapping and killing spree in Lanao del Sur. In one case, the group beheaded two captives.

It also launched bomb attacks on selected targets, like military camps.

In February, soldiers battled the Maute Group for days in Butig town, Lanao del Sur, which led to the killing of several of its leaders.

The group retaliated, however, launching more attacks and, on Aug. 27, freeing eight of its members among 23 inmates in a daring raid on the Lanao del Sur provincial jail.

Despite Maute Group’s increasing notoriety and its pledge of allegiance to IS, military and police authorities said there was still no evidence to back speculation that the Maute Group had merged forces with Abu Sayyaf.

Director General Ronald “Bato” Dela Rosa, PNP chief, said he did not have information about the merger of Maute and Abu Sayyaf.

Maj. Filemon Tan Jr., spokesperson of the Western Mindanao Command, said on the contrary, both groups are competing for recognition by IS in a bid to get financial support.

“Until now, we haven’t monitored any unusual support from IS to the local bandits and we haven’t seen any evidence they support each other,” Tan said.

Tourism puts Bicol ahead among regions,"LEGAZPI CITY—Tourism thrust Bicol into its peak economic performance in 2015, registering the highest growth rate among regions in the country, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA).

Bicol’s economy grew by at least 8.4 percent, higher than the national economic growth rate of about 6.3 percent.

“Tourism will continue to be the major growth driver of the region’s economy,” said Cynthia Perdiz, PSA regional director. It creates sustainable jobs, she said.

Take the case of Jovellar town in Albay province.

Eddie Pedrajeta, barangay chair of Quitinday, said tourism brought his village to life after the Quitinday falls and its underground river attracted thousands of tourists. More than 50 families earned extra income from tourist arrivals, he said.

The places started to be noticed in 2012, but tourist traffic increased only in 2015, local officials said.

“Tourism gives us a big opportunity. I don’t have to leave my family to look for another job,” said Analiza Broqueza, 39.

Broqueza stopped working as a housemaid in Batangas province to return to Quitinday. She now sells “halo-halo,” pili candies and food to tourists.

Camarines Sur is still the most visited province, with 2.06 million tourists in 2015, or 45.5 percent of arrivals. But Albay posted the highest growth in tourist arrivals at 1.41 million in 2015 from 959,000 in 2014.

The National Economic and Development Authority in Bicol said the region’s growth rate last year was almost double its growth rate in 2014 of 4.3 percent and exceeded the regional target of 6.7 percent.

The PSA attributed the growth to the focus on tourism by agencies and programs working in harmony. Aggressive promotion and marketing of the region as a tourist destination helped, it said.

In the service sector (waiters, hotel workers, etc.), growth was fueled by the jump in tourist arrivals from
4 million in 2014 to 4.52 million in 2015.

Perdiz said Bicol’s showing was also driven by the growth of other businesses (manufacturing, construction, mining, etc.), from just 5.3 percent in 2014 to 23.7 percent in 2015.

Dr. Ricardo Beljica, an economist and professor at Bicol University in Albay, said the vibrant tourism industry drove the rise of malls, hotels and tourism-oriented enterprises.

“There is a high propensity to consume on the part of Bicolanos,” Beljica said. “Massive government projects helped a lot.”

More investments are expected to pour into the region’s major economic hubs—Naga and Legazpi cities, the PSA said. ",14/08/2016,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/805916/tourism-puts-bicol-ahead-among-regions

","LEGAZPI CITY—At least 1,425 passengers were stranded in major ports in Bicol after the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) suspended the sailing of all types of sea vessels following the hoisting of public storm warning signal number one over four provinces here by the weather bureau on Friday.

The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa) raised storm signal number one over Albay, Camarines Sur, Catanduanes and Sorsogon Friday morning as the Regional Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (RDRRMC) went on alert after tropical depression “Carina” approached Bicol.

"9,000 leftist group members to attend Duterte’s Sona","A 9,000-strong crowd composed of members of Bagong Alyansang Makabayan’s Southern Tagalog, Bicol and Mindanao chapters are headed to Quezon City for President Rodrigo Duterte’s first State of the Nation Address (Sona), bringing with them a newfound hope that the current administration will address their longstanding concerns.
The group, which initially converged in Calamba, Laguna, Saturday morning, were greeted by Bayan-NCR members at the Alabang viaduct in Muntinlupa City later that afternoon.

Bayan-NCR spokesperson Mark Louie Aquino said that while they are happy that the new President is more supportive of leftist groups, they remain critical of his actions and policies especially when it comes to issues of militarization of Lumad communities, contractualization, power outages especially in Bicol, union-busting and the K-12 educational system.

Aquino said they also condemn the recent spate of extrajudicial killings of suspected drug criminals, which has been fueled by Duterte’s strong campaign against illegal drugs.

“We support the campaign to end drug crimes, but lately we’ve been seeing a pattern that most of those being killed are just small-time players,” said Aquino.

Still, Aquino said they are “giving [Duterte] a chance” to prove himself, at least in his first 100 days in office.

He added that like at the President’s inauguration, Bayan is expecting their leaders to be allowed inside the Session Hall of Batasang Pambansa on Monday. ",23/07/2016,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/798540/9000-leftist-group-members-to-attend-dutertes-sona

Poor village draws national attention,"Incoming Vice President Leni Robredo’s choice of the leader of the remote village of Punta Tarawal in Calabanga, Camarines Sur province, to administer her oath of office on June 30 has also put on the spotlight one of the poorest communities in the Bicol region.

More than the electoral support of the village, Robredo had said she wanted Ronaldo Coner, the village chair, to swear her into office because it will symbolize her advocacies—“giving face and voice to people on the fringes.”

All the 187 votes cast for Vice President in Punta Tarawal (population: 408), the smallest village of Calabanga, went to the outgoing representative of the province’s third congressional district. Her five other rivals got zero.

Disaster prone

Punta Tarawal is a marshland where mangroves and nipa palms thrive, but it has no water supply, either for drinking or household use, because there is no groundwater source. Only about 2 percent of its land area is habitable, Coner said.

Coner lamented that only about 300 of the more than 400 inhabitants are actually living in Punta Tarawal due to lack of basic services and facilities.

Some have dug a well, but its water is salty. Most of them go to the Bicol River to bathe and wash their clothes.

There is an elementary school with classes for Grades 1 to 6.

Coner yearned that someday a road leading to the village would be built and correct impressions that it is an island. That road, he hoped, would bring progress to their community.

“We could easily sell our products if there is an access road and then, maybe, people from our village would come home and help develop our place,” he said.

Punta Tarawal is vulnerable to storm surges and residents must evacuate whenever a typhoon comes.

“We need an evacuation center that could withstand strong typhoons,” Coner said. Some of the men would stay during calamities to attend to their animals and property, he added.

Project beneficiary

The village is one of the beneficiaries of the P142-million seawall project that Robredo had facilitated for residents of several coastal villages in Calabanga. It was once the docking place of trawl boats of her father-in-law, Jose Robredo, in the 1970s to the 1980s, said Salvacion Templonuevo, 72, a village councilor.

Templonuevo said most of Jose’s workers in trawl fishing came from their village. She said that after Robredo’s late husband, Jesse, was elected mayor of Naga, the business stopped.

While cruising toward Punta Tarawal, stilt-like bamboo structures standing in the middle of the 700-meter-wide Bicol River cannot escape attention.

Jose Asuro, village chief of Balongay, the take-off point to Punta Tarawal, said the bamboo structures, locally called biyakos, are actually illegal because the fishing method uses a pouch with fine-meshed nets.

But Asuro found it difficult to enforce the law because the owners of biyakos are also subsistence fishermen while commercial trawls continue to operate inside the 15-kilometer municipal waters in San Miguel Bay.

VP oath-taking

Robredo’s oath-taking before a village chief is the first ceremony for a newly elected Vice President which, according to Camarines Sur Rep. Salvio Fortuno is within the bounds of Republic Act No. 10755.

Fortuno said RA 10755, which he is the principal author at the House of Representatives, was signed into law by President Aquino on March 29 this year, amending Executive Order No. 292, or Administrative Code of 1987, to include punong barangay or village chiefs among the authorities who could swear in public officials, including the President.

Coner is excited, and for the meantime, stopped his business of buying and selling crabs until after he has sworn in the second highest elected official of the land.

He started in village politics at 23 years old when he ran and won as village councilor in 1988. He became barangay secretary after a term in the council.

He won as village chief of Punta Tarawal in the 1998 and 2001 elections. He lost in his attempt for a third and final term but won in 2013 and retook the seat of punong barangay.

On June 15, Boyet Dy, head of Robredo’s transition team, named Coner as the official who would administer the incoming Vice President’s oath.

“I was stunned when I was named on the television newscast. I cannot believe it and I could not sleep at that time thinking why among the (village chiefs) in the country, I was chosen to administer the oath,” he said.

Coner said he was told by Robredo’s staff to just be ready and prepare himself for the ceremony to be held in Metro Manila. He was given a copy of a text for the rites.

On Friday, Robredo’s staff bought him a new barong Tagalog, black slacks, shoes and belt which he will wear during the oath-taking ceremony.

Since the announcement on June 15, all major television networks had visited Punta Tarawal.

“It is a great honor that our village chief was chosen to administer the oath-taking of Vice President Leni Robredo. You see, our small village is singled out among thousands of villages all over the Philippines,” Templonuevo said.",23/06/2016,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/791922/poor-village-draws-national-attention
Mt. Bulusan belches ash over 19 villages,"LEGAZPI CITY—Mt. Bulusan in Sorsogon on Friday spewed out a two-kilometer high plume that covered 19 villages with thin layers of ash, affecting some 18,575 residents, the Office of Civil Defense (OCD) Bicol said.

The cloud drifted toward the northwest, and were felt in the towns of Juban and Casiguran, where ash rained down on residents who were given face masks and towels, the agency said. There were, however, no immediate reports of any casualties as a result of the sudden, five-minute steam-driven or “phreatic” explosion.

Philippine Institute of Volcanolgy and Seismology (Phivolcs) resident volcanologist Ed Laguerta said the eruption was similar to an event in February, when Bulusan ejected steam and ash 500 meters into the sky. He said the volcano also expelled a 1.5-kilometer ash cloud in June last year that affected six villages, also in Juban town.

 

Casiguran, Juban affected

Luisito Mendoza Jr., head of Casiguran Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (MDRRMO), said an estimated 15,000 of those affected on Friday were residents in the villages of Inlagadian, Casay, Mabini, Tigbao, San Juan, San Antonio, San Isidro, Rizal, Tiris, Gogon, Central, Timbayog, Adovis and Colambis, all in Casiguran.

In Juban town, at least 3,575 persons from five villages of Tughan, Cogon, Aroroy, Rangas and Añog were affected, according to Lizpeth Nicolas, head of Juban MDRRMO.

However, the ashfall was characterized as minimal and required no evacuations.

Phivolcs, in an advisory, said it had raised the first of a five-step alert level covering Mt. Bulusan, indicating that “hydrothermal processes are underway beneath the volcano that may lead to more steam-driven explosions.”

“The local government units and the public are reminded that entry to the

4-kilometer radius Permanent Danger Zone is strictly prohibited due to the possibility of sudden and hazardous steam-driven or phreatic eruptions,” it said.

It said civil aviation authorities must also advise pilots to avoid flying close to the volcano’s summit, with residents living near streams or channels of water particularly on the southwest and northwest sectors of the Mt. Bulusan advised to watch out for sudden lahar flows in case of heavy rains.

Clearing operations

Laguerta said he advised the towns affected to immediately conduct clearing operations in major road networks affected by ash falls to avoid endangering motorists. Volcanic ash may cause the roads to turn slippery when it rains.

Rachelle Miranda, OCD spokesperson, in a phone interview said no evacuation was reported as of press time, but the agency has already prepared masks, tarps, vests and helmets since March this year for the usage of six towns located around the volcano.

The Philippines sits on the so-called Pacific Rim of Fire, which is dotted with volcanoes and fault lines. In 1991,

Mt. Pinatubo in central Luzon exploded, in what is believed to be the second biggest volcanic event of the century. It spewed millions of tons of magma and ash, darkening the skies and subsequently causing a global cooling of temperatures.",11/06/2016,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/790115/mt-bulusan-belches-ash-over-19-villages
DepEd admits classroom shortage in Bicol persists,"LEGAZPI CITY—Thousands of senior high school students in Bicol may have to attend classes in the shade of trees, in multipurpose halls or share rooms with other students as the Department of Education (DepEd) admitted that there is a continuing shortage of classrooms in the region.

Roy Bañas, spokesperson of DepEd Bicol, said only 1,127 classrooms have been built and ready for use by students when classes officially start this month.

At least 2,000 classrooms are still under construction. If completed by the first semester of classes, the 2,000 classrooms would bring the total number of senior high school classrooms in the region to 3,127.

The classrooms are being built under a P2.4-billion project started by the Department of Public Works and Highways in the last quarter of 2015.

The regional DepEd office said it expects at least 92,522 enrollees in senior high school in the provinces of Albay, Masbate, Sorsogon, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur and Catanduanes.

Bañas said adjustments would have to be made as construction of new classrooms continue.

School officials, he said, are offering temporary solutions which include increasing class sizes to make room for more students per classroom.

Bañas said classes or sections “were merged to maximize the use of classrooms.”

In many cases, he said, school officials decided to use other rooms not devoted for classes, like faculty rooms, libraries, offices of school officials, computer rooms and other rooms that can be converted into classrooms in the meantime.

In some cases, Bañas added, schools would have to rent space in private buildings nearby. The last recourse, he said, would be to conduct classes in shifts.

Holding classes in shifts, he said, is the last recourse because “we don’t want our students to go home late.”

Despite the shortage in classrooms, Bañas said the region is 100 percent prepared to implement the K-12 program that seeks to reform the country’s educational system by, among other things, adding more years to high school.

Out of 665 secondary schools in Bicol, 611 would offer senior high classes, Bañas said.",05/06/2016,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/789172/deped-admits-classroom-shortage-in-bicol-persists
"No ‘Bicol vote’ exists, but Bicolanos urged to rally behind Leni","NAGA CITY—With Rep. Leni Robredo leading in pre-election surveys among candidates for vice president who have roots in the Bicol region, Bicolano voters must rally behind her to catapult her to the second-highest elective position in the country, a retired Camarines Sur prosecutor said on Tuesday.

Agapito Rosales said this is the time that Bicol voters must unite and support Robredo if only to avoid a situation similar to the failed Nacionalista Party (NP) presidential nomination of Sen. Dominador Aytona, a native of Albay province, in 1965.

Rosales recalled that in the heat of the race to capture the nomination, Aytona withdrew in favor of an Ilocano rival, then Senate President Ferdinand Marcos, who would eventually become president.

The similarities of the vice presidential race today with the NP primaries in 1965 could not be ignored with the emerging rivalry between the Ilocos and Bicol regions, represented by Sen. Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr., the late former president’s son and the latest survey front-runner, who is closely followed by Robredo, he said.

“I know that the Bicolano candidates are bound by their parties, but still I urge them to advice their people to rally behind [Robredo] if we want to elect a Bicolano vice president,” he said.

Apart from Robredo, whose parents are from Sorsogon province and Naga City, the other vice presidential candidates from Bicol are Senators Francis Escudero and Gregorio Honasan, both of Sorsogon; and Antonio Trillanes IV of Albay. Sen. Alan Peter Cayetano is not a Bicol native, but the family of his wife, Taguig City Mayor Lani Cayetano, is from Albay.

But a “Bicol vote” does not exist, said Fr. Wilmer Tria, professor of Philosophy of Ateneo de Naga University. Voters, he said, choose candidates based on conscience, not on regional affiliations.

Prof. Alexander de Guzman, former chair of the Political Science Department of the College of Social Sciences and Philosophy in Bicol University, sees a tough fight for Bicolano candidates in the vice presidential race.

“With three vice presidential bets rooted in Sorsogon and two with connections in Albay, Bicol is polarized and the Bicol vote becomes immaterial,” he said. The region, composed of six provinces, has more than 3 million voters.

According to Tria, a “conscience vote” is different from the bloc votes delivered by some religious groups “where there is only one source of wisdom and nobody cannot question it.”

“When we say Bicol vote, it’s just territorial, geographical … it means how many potential voters the region has,” Tria said.

Simply put, a Bicolano voter does not automatical ly vote for a Bicolano candidate in the national position, he said.

The Commission on Elections said the number of qualified voters in this year’s elections reached 54,363,844. Bicol has 3,121,662 registered voters while the Ilocos region, where Marcos hails, has 2,950,775.

In the 1998 presidential election, Sen. Raul Roco, a Bicolano, failed to muster a solid victory in the six provinces in the region when Masbate supported the eventual winner, Joseph Estrada. Roco placed third and garnered 13.83 percent of the votes.

More Bicol politicos join Duterte camp,"NAGA CITY—Despite allegations that he has undeclared wealth, presidential front-runner and Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte continues to attract big names in politics, with Bicol officials joining the bandwagon.

On Friday, Camarines Sur Rep. Rolando Andaya Jr., Albay Rep. Al Francis Bichara, Ako Bicol Rep. Christopher Co and former Catanduanes Gov. Leandro Verceles Jr. pledged their support for the tough-talking Duterte in a campaign rally attended by 10,000 spectators at the old central business district here.

Bichara is running for Albay governor while Verceles is staging a comeback in the lone congressional district of Catanduanes against reelectionist Rep. Cesar Sarmiento of the Liberal Party (LP).

Andaya, who earlier supported Sen. Grace Poe’s presidential bid, said he switched to Duterte because he believes the Davao mayor is a leader who can stand for the interest of Camarines Sur province.

“It was a process. There were feelers sent. The agreement is mutual. Rounds of consultations with leaders were done and the obvious answer was to transfer to the camp of Duterte,” he said.

ANDAYA
ANDAYA

Andaya, a Nationalist People’s Coalition candidate, who represents the first district of Camarines Sur, is running for reelection against Apolinar “Yonyon” Napoles, a priest, of LP.

At the end of his two-hour talk, Duterte raised the hands of Andaya, Bichara, Verceles, Co and a number of candidates running for local positions in Naga City.

Dante Jimenez, founder of the Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption and one of the supporters of Duterte, said the people who gathered to see the mayor here were not herded.

“We can see that Bicolanos stuck it out with Duterte. It’s unbelievable,”  Jimenez said.

He said supporters of Duterte in Bicol are called “One Bicol,” which was conceptualized in Masbate when Duterte visited the island province in the second week of April.

Jimenez said One Bicol comprised prominent politicians in the region that include former Gov. Jesus Typoco Jr. of Camarines Norte, Andaya of Camarines Sur, Verceles of Catanduanes, the late Leovic Dioneda (who died on April 18, but replaced by his son, Mark Eric, in the Sorsogon City mayoral race) in Sorsogon, former Gov. Antonio Kho in Masbate, and Bichara and Co in Albay.

"Military in Southern Tagalog, Bicol downgrades alert despite NPA anniv","LUCENA CITY—The military has downgraded its security alert in its camps in Southern Luzon this week, even as the New People’s Army (NPA) celebrated its 47th anniversary on Tuesday.

Lt. Col. Angelo Guzman, spokesman of the military’s Southern Luzon Command (Solcom) based in Camp Nakar here, said the alert status for “security and emergency preparedness and response” in all military camps in Southern Tagalog and Bicol regions had been downgraded to “white” on Monday, after the observance of Holy Week.

Guzman said “white alert” status is the lowest awareness level in the military, which “signifies normalcy with no imminent or monitored security threats.”

He said that Tuesday, the NPA’s founding anniversary, was an ordinary day with normal security preparations in place.

However, in view of the NPA anniversary, Guzman reminded all units to “remain vigilant and ensure security measures are undertaken” to prevent and counter possible attacks by communist rebels.

Guzman said field commanders can always raise the alert level to “blue” or “red” if security situations in their areas call for it.

He assured that government forces have been continuously conducting anti-insurgency operations.

“Solcom chief (Lt. General Ricardo Visaya) gave his marching order to go deep into NPA lairs and neutralize them,” Guzman said.

Last week, NPA rebels and government forces engaged in separate clashes in Camarines Sur and Camarines Norte provinces, where three suspected communist guerrillas were killed.

Two weeks ago, at least 11 explosions, allegedly initiated by communist rebels, rocked the island province of Masbate. Two policemen were hurt in the said incidents.",29/03/2016,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/776836/military-in-southern-tagalog-bicol-downgrades-alert-despite-npa-anniv
Landfill law violation: Cure seen in amendment,"LEGAZPI CITY—If you can’t comply with the law, amend it.

Albay Gov. Joey Salceda said this could be the solution to the failure of more than 500 local officials to heed the law requiring local governments to operate sanitary landfills and which bans open dumps.

Five towns and a city in Albay are among 50 local governments facing charges for operating open dumps in violation of the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act (Republic Act No. 9003), a 15-year-old law that makes it a crime for local governments to operate open dumps.

The National Solid Waste Management Commission (NWSMC), an office under the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) that oversees implementation of the law, has charged at least 500 local officials early this month with violating the law for operating open dumps in their towns and cities.

Salceda defended the officials, saying complying with RA 9003 is tough for towns and cities that do not have funds to build and operate sanitary landfills.

“The level of compliance being demanded by the law from (local governments) is ab initio (from the start) not achievable,” said Salceda in a statement on his Facebook page.

Salceda, now candidate for representative of Albay, said he would push for amendments to RA 9003 if he wins a seat in the House.

The proposed amendment, he said, would provide the DENR with funds to help local governments build and operate sanitary landfills.

“With so much national roads now completed, even widened, there exists now a fiscal space for this national imperative,” he said.

In an earlier interview, Roberto Sheen, Environment Management Bureau (EMB) Bicol regional director, said among those facing charges in the Ombudsman are officials in the towns of Daraga, Camalig, Guinobatan, Polangui and Tiwi, and Tabaco City in Albay.

Sheen said NSWMC found that the local governments there had failed to comply with RA 9003 despite repeated warnings.

The costs of building and maintaining sanitary landfills, however, may be too steep for these local government units.

Rudolph Lita, chief of the solid waste and local government relations section of the regional EMB, said a local government would need a minimum of P25 million, or P5 million per hectare, to build a Category 1 sanitary landfill with a leachate pond and wastewater treatment facility.

Add to that the cost of operating and maintaining the landfill.

Salceda urged the EMB to issue a set of criteria in determining compliance.

“This exposes noncomplying (local governments) to disproportionate shame at this stage of the political season,” said Salceda. “Shame one, shame all,” he said.

While the Albay provincial government has been helping local governments comply with RA 9003, Salceda said they have seen little or no support from the national government “given the cost of environmental compliance in the middle of so many imposed mandates devolved without the corresponding transfer of resources.”",28/02/2016,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/769148/landfill-law-violation-cure-seen-in-amendment
Robredo urges Bicolanos: Carry both Roxas and me to Malacañang,"NAGA CITY—“Please help Mar Roxas too.”

Administration vice presidential candidate Leni Robredo asked this to her fellow Nagueños during the two-day campaign blitz of the “Daang Matuwid” coalition in the Bicol region.

“Ang aking pakiusap na kung ako ay tutulungan ninyo ay tutulungan niyo rin si Sec. Mar Roxas,” Robredo said in her native dialect before hundreds of yellow-clad supporters at Plaza Quezon in Naga City.

(My request is if you are going to help me, please help Sec. Mar Roxas too.)

Her speeches in their visit in several cities of Camarines Sur province on Friday were centered on pitching for the Liberal Party standard-bearer, who is currently lagging behind Senator Grace Poe in recent polls.

READ: Robredo returns to roots as LP goes to Bicol

Robredo recalled the times when Roxas stood behind their family when her husband Jesse Robredo, who was a Mayor of the capital city of Camarines Sur for 19 years, died in a plane  crash off the Masbate coast in 2012.

“Ipapaalala ko po sa inyo, lalo na sa mga taga-Naga, bago pa lang naging mayor si Jesse, lagi na nating bisita si Mar. Malaki o maliit na okasyon basta invited ni Jesse andyan siya. Fiesta, hindi fiesta, andyan siya,” said Robredo.

(Let me remind you, especially those from Naga, that even before Jesse became mayor, Mar would constantly visit us. Whether it was a big or a small occasion, as long as Jesse would invite him, Mar would come. Whether it was the festival or not, he would always be there.)

After the former Interior Secretary’s death, Robredo was thrust into politics due to  the public clamor for her to run and challenge the Villafuerte dynasty holding the Camarines Sur third district congressional seat.

The late Robredo was then succeeded by Roxas as the Department of Interior and Local Government chief.

The incumbent lawmaker was faced with the similar dilemma when Roxas asked her to become his running mate in the 2016 elections.

“Sana samahan niyo po kami dahil wala naman akong sasandalan kung ‘di kayo. Wala namang dadamay sa akin ng buong-buo kundi kayo,” Robredo added.

(I hope you join us because I have no one to lean on except you. No one would wholeheartedly empathize with us except you.)

Robredo explained that it is important for both of them to win because her term as the future vice president would be not as productive if Roxas doesn’t become president.

“Lagi ko pong sinasabi kung tutulungan niyo ako pero kung hindi niyo tutulungan ang aking presidente, ay hindi po ako makakabwelo dahil depende sa kung anong tranbaho ang ibibigay saken ng presidnte. Kaya ganyan ka-importante kung tutulungan niyo ako at tutulungan niyo si Sec. Mar,” she said.

(I have been saying that if you will help me, but not help my president, then I won’t be able to make my moves because it would really depend on the responsibilities that the president would give me. That is why it is important for you to help Sec. Mar if you are going to help me.)

Robredo also asked her Bicolano supporters to give the equal amount of support to the 12 senators under the administration-backed coalition who all promised to continue the gains of President Benigno Aquino III’s “straight path.”

Admin bets vow to shower CamSur with infra projects,"IRIGA CITY—The expansion of the runway of Naga Airport would be among the projects the Mar Roxas-Leni Robredo administration will prioritize, Reelectionist senator Franklin Drilon said in a Liberal Party sortie in Camarines Sur.

Liberal Party senatorial bets vowed on Friday to boost the tourism of Camarines Sur by pursuing the improvement of Naga City airport should they win in the upcoming elections.

“Importante ang turismo ng Camarines Sur. Ito ay tututukan ng Ro-Ro government,” Drilon said in a press conference before the LP campaign kickoff in the home province of Representative Robredo.

The current administration has allotted P3.5 billion for the expansion of Naga Airport’s runway and construction of new facilities seen to be completed in 2019.

Drilon said Naga City records the highest number of tourist arrivals among all cities and municipalities in Camarines Sur.

Since it has a shorter runway compared to other airports, Naga City Airport can only accommodate small turbo-propeller aircraft due to its limited capacities.

Senatorial aspirant Mark Lapid also said that aside from refurbishing the domestic airport, he would also push for the improved implementation of Philippine National Railways Bicol Express.

PNR operations in Bicol, which runs from Tutuban in Manila to Legazpi, are currently suspended after one of its trains got derailed in Sariaya, Quezon in 2012.

“Yung mga kalsada going to Caramoan at Peñafrancia museum talagang makikita niyo na magiimprove,” Lapid, formerly the chief of Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise Zone Authority (Tieza), promised.

“In the same way that Roxas City was Mar’s hometown, Naga is Leni’s. Their dreams of helping all Filipinos began from dreams of helping their neighbors. We chose Naga and Roxas City because of the symbolism of them returning home before embarking on the greatest journey of their lives thus far,” coalition spokesperson and Akbayan Rep.

On Saturday, the administration bets will visit Masbate province and cities of Tabacco, Ligao and Legazpi in Albay Province which is led by Gov. Joey Salceda, an LP ally.

Robredo will be competing with three Bicolanos—Senators Chiz Escudero, Antonio Trillanes IV and Gringo Honasan—in the vice presidential race.

But with her current standing in the surveys, Robredo is hopeful that her voter preference ratings would continue to shoot up.

Robredo got the biggest gain in the latest Laylo survey with an increase of nine percentage points in January to 20 percent. The lawmaker placed third after Escudero and Senator Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr.

"Jeep fare cut by P0.50 in Cagayan Valley, Bicol","MINIMUM jeepney fare in Cagayan Valley and Bicol regions will be reduced by 50 centavos to P7 due to falling oil prices, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said on Wednesday.

“In line with the board’s order to conduct public hearing in the region to get the sentiment of various transport and consumer groups, we have come to a resolution to grant a provisional fare adjustment in Cagayan Valley region,” LTFRB Chair Winston Ginez said in a statement.

From P7.50, the fare for the first four kilometers will now be P7, while the rate for the succeeding kilometers will remain the same. Persons with disability, senior citizens and students are still entitled to a 20-percent fare discount.

In announcing its decision, the LTFRB noted the drop in the price of diesel by nine consecutive times in Cagayan Valley (Region 2), which is composed of Batanes, Cagayan, Isabela, Nueva Vizcaya and Quirino provinces.

Some transport groups had opposed the fare reduction, citing the still high cost of spare parts, maintenance and labor. The LTFRB said these operating expenses were not on a daily basis.

Public hearings for a provisional fare rollback in Bicol (Region 5) were held in Naga City in Camarines Sur province and Daraga town in Albay province. The region is composed of Albay, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, Catanduanes, Masbate and Sorsogon provinces.

“It’s only fair for the riding public in Bicol to also benefit from the continuous drop in oil prices,” Ginez said.

The LTFRB initially implemented the P7 provisional fare in Metro Manila, Central Luzon and Calabarzon upon the voluntary petition for rollback filed by four transport groups in January.

What it takes to be an elite SAF trooper,"“My job is not for the weak or fainthearted.”

Che Gurrobat-Pascual, 32, remembers those words of her cousin, Max Jim Tria, describing his job as an officer in the Philippine National Police Special Action Force (SAF) at a family get-together in Catanduanes province two years ago.

Tria sported a thick beard and disheveled hair, a far cry from the scrawny and goofy boy Pascual had seen growing up in the island province in Bicol.

The change made Pascual ask what Tria did for a living.

“He didn’t elaborate… [but] it was then that I started to realize how adventurous his life must be,” Pascual, a news producer, said in an interview with the Inquirer in Quezon City.

Two years after her last conversation with him, Pascual understood what her cousin meant: Tria, 27, was one of the 44 SAF commandos killed in a gun battle with Moro rebels in Mamasapano, Maguindanao province, on Jan. 25, 2015, after a covert operation to take down Malaysian terrorist Zulkifli bin Hir, alias Marwan, backfired.

The SAF is the counterterrorism unit of the PNP. It is an elite force whose members are trained in both law enforcement and military operations.

In short, “[the SAF] is like the police and the military combined,” Senior Insp. Jayson Baldos, spokesperson for the SAF, said in an interview at the unit’s headquarters in Camp Bagong Diwa in Taguig City.

Besides counterterrorism operations, the SAF also handles  anti-insurgency and hostage rescue operations. The job also includes search and rescue operations during disasters and civil disturbance management. SAF officers are also tapped to provide security to VIPs, including the President of the Philippines.

Training

Of all police units, only the SAF trains its officers as commandos. Baldos said the training, at the unit’s school in Fort Santo Domingo in Laguna province, was as rigorous as the Philippine Army Scout Rangers course.

Like all rookie police applicants, aspiring SAF officers first have to meet the general requirements and documentary requirements for Police Officer 1 (PO1) then undergo the six-month basic public safety course at the National Police Training Institute in Laguna. From there they move on to field training, which takes another six months, said  Supt. Cyril Jasmin, the SAF commandant who also heads the SAF training school.

The field training program is like the on-the-job training program for all rookie police, where they are distributed to police stations to get a feel of the daily police grind, ranging from investigation and intelligence work to traffic and patrolling, Baldos said.

Then comes the training unique to the SAF—the commando course, which takes another six months, although in practice, it could take up to two years, Baldos said.

‘No comfort’

For the duration of the commando course, the trainees live in tarpaulin tents pitched on humid, dusty fields in Fort Santo Domingo. This “tent city” serves as their barracks as they undergo daily physical exercises interspersed with classroom instructions.

“You will never feel comfort there,” Baldos said, recalling that his days in training usually began at 4 a.m. and ended at 10 p.m.

When the Inquirer visited the training camp, the trainees demonstrated their skills at various rope and obstacle courses.

The firing range was busy, filled with students training in marksmanship, shooting pistols and rifles at legal-size paper targets set at 5 to 200 meters away.

A regular sight at the camp would be students on “load runs,” in which they jog around a 1.2-kilometer oval carrying rucksacks filled with 18 kilos of sand on their backs.

Students are subjected to this  exercise at least thrice a day—training for future missions in which they have to lug around weapons, ammunition, rations and medical equipment, Jasmin said.
Phases

The training at the camp has five phases, with subjects ranging from first aid, jungle, mountaineering and navigation techniques to communications, weapons efficiency, combat skills, air to ground support and marksmanship.

SAF training includes mission planning, which sees the students drafting operation plans from real intelligence.

Eventually, the students will be sent out of the camp for field training. But the final phase, the test mission, sees the students deployed on real operations for at least a month.

If they are embroiled in an encounter with enemy forces during the test mission, they will automatically be recommended for graduation, Jasmin said.

Only the really tough survive boot camp. For instance, the class graduating this summer started  with 103 students. Now only 92 are left.

Most dropouts are due to medical reasons, Jasmin said.

After graduation the troopers receive their reward: the black beret with the winged sword logo of the SAF.

The road to becoming “elite” police officers doesn’t end there, though. The SAF has its version of master’s studies.

Special courses
After commando school, the troopers have the option to take further “specialized” courses: “Sureshock” or the urban counterrevolutionary warfare course, a requirement for counterterrorism units and crucial training for hostage situations; explosives and ordnance disposal; K9; airborne, for air operations; and the maritime tactical operation course (MTOC).

According to Baldos, the MTOC is exclusive schooling for the “elite of the elite” SAF troopers, the Seaborne. To qualify for the MTOC, troopers should be “Sureshock-qualified, and airborne-qualified.”

The commandos are then distributed to nine battalions stationed across the country, including the rapid deployment battalion, the force support battalion, and the air unit. Each battalion has its own eligibility test.

Seaborne

“Seaborne” is the monicker for the 84th Special Action Company (SAC)—the strike force for “Oplan Exodus” deployed to get Marwan. Of the 44 SAF commandos killed in the operation, nine were from Seaborne.

Tria, reported as “the last man standing” of the SAF 44,  died with members of the 55th SAC, which was deployed as the blocking force to cover the Seaborne’s exit. Of the 36 members of the 55th SAC, only one survived the gun battle in Mamasapano.

Tria, the lone commando from the 54th SAC in Oplan Exodus, had been tapped as a sniper for the mission.

“I have no doubt he died fighting. He wouldn’t be taken alive,” Pascual said, pride ringing in her voice.

Tria was reported to have died with a grenade in each hand. “The enemy really wouldn’t have dared approach [Tria],” Baldos said.

Citing autopsy reports made available to the family, Pascual said Tria did not appear to have been shot dead, as he was hit in his extremities. He most likely died of blood loss.
Tria died with the rank of senior inspector. After a posthumous promotion for the SAF 44, he became a chief inspector— the same rank as his father, a police officer in Catanduanes, Pascual said.

‘Serve the country’

Surprisingly, after Mamasapano, the SAF saw an increase in applicants, mostly from Mindanao.

In July and October 2015, around 500 SAF applicants took their oaths as PO1s. “Most of them were from Mindanao,” Baldos said.

Those policemen are now undergoing the basic stages of training. Baldos could not say if they were inspired by the SAF 44, but he said: “They must have a sense of volunteerism. [You will apply with the SAF only] if you are willing to risk personal comfort and security to serve the country. The risks are higher than for [an ordinary] policeman.”",31/01/2016,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/760256/what-it-takes-to-be-an-elite-saf-trooper

A first taste of condo life in Bicol,"Bicolanos craving for a taste of condominium life need not look far to Metro Manila to stay in one of the modern-day structures that have somehow described the local urban sprawl.

In Legazpi City, the capital of Albay province and a bustling center of regional affairs, a big realty firm is pursuing an affordable condominium project in a 23,289-square-meter property, which offers an alternative site to traffic-plagued Metro Manila. It is the first of such kind of housing development in Albay and Bicol.

“Here, you can experience nature within the city,” said Elizaldy Co, chair of Eco Realty Ventures Inc., which owns the project proponent, Sunwestville Realty and Development Corp.

“This is balanced with the countryside sense and lifestyle. You don’t need to go to Manila. The traffic on Edsa is also the same with the traffic in Metro Manila condos,” Co said.

Eco Homes Bayshore in Barangay Puro will provide residents a sustainable and economical way of life. Seven three-story buildings will rise in 3 hectares of land—part of the 70 ha owned by Sunwestville in the southern part of Legazpi, 3 kilometers from the central business district.

The main concept “is to help even the middle wage earners to have their own house, especially those who are just leasing,” Co said.

The resort-village will have a total of 1,022 units, with floor areas of 27.6 sq m for an inner unit and 40.92 sq m for the standard one.

“Owning a condo will cost you P3 million to P5 million—that’s the cheapest in Manila. But here, we offer it for only P1.1 million to P1.5 million,” Co said.

Before the project’s grand launching on the last week of November, almost 400 units were reserved, offered through loans from banks and the Home Development Mutual Fund.

Amenities

Eco Homes Bayshore will also have a swimming pool, multipurpose building, fitness gym, lounges, basketball court and other exclusive amenities.

Residents can also refresh and feel the breeze from Legazpi Boulevard, a 3-km coastal road network extending from the central business district and port area to the southern villages. The boulevard shore is only about 500 meters from the development site.

Co said all the ingredients needed for a city lifestyle would be put up near the condominium buildings.

“Like in the concept of tourism, ‘live, work and play,’ we will make all the developments in this community complementary (with) every stay in the province. When tourists feel secure in a place, they tend to settle in the same area even until their retirement,” he said.

A hospital and a building for business process outsourcing companies will soon rise in the 70-ha land area, as well as a school, market and even a terminal for public utility vehicles.

Typhoon-proof

In front of the condominium units, Eco Homes Subdivision will rise.

“We expect to have a huge community in this area so we need to give their basic needs to make this area sustainable. The trend today is sustainable development, to make it more economical, we need to give them a place (where they can find) work, (get) entertainment and (avail of) complete amenities,” Co said.

Local engineers have been commissioned to produce the typhoon-proof design of the buildings. The structures are expected to withstand a supertyphoon with sustaining winds of 250 kilometer per hour.

“This may be an elevated area (10 meters elevation from the ground), but we planned it well to be a typhoon-proof building. The structure itself can survive even for 300 (kph winds) and this is also safe from a storm surge,” Co said.
Co’s real estate ventures in Legazpi include Renaissance Garden on Washington Drive, Highlands Subdivision in Estanza, Tektone Villages in Dapdap and Misibis Residential Resort in Bacacay town, Albay.",07/01/2016,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/753203/a-first-taste-of-condo-life-in-bicol

The bus subsequently careened into a ravine at the right side of the road, he said.

A villager alerted the local police station of the accident through their hotline mobile phone number, Divino said in a phone interview.

A team of policemen, firemen and rescuers was immediately dispatched to the accident site some 20 kilometers from the town proper, Divino said.

He said there were about 24 injured passengers who were rushed to the St. Peter General Hospital in Calauag town proper and to the Magsaysay Memorial District Hospital in nearby Lopez town.
