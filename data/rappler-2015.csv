Bishop calls for more troops in Bicol to stop poll violence,"LEGAZPI CITY, Philippines – Bishop Joel “Bong” Baylon of the Diocese of Legazpi on Thursday, October 15, called for the increased presence of government security forces in the Bicol region to ensure peaceful elections.

“We call on the law enforcers to intensify their campaign against loose firearms and to dismantle the presence of private armed groups in Bicol,” Baylon said.

Baylon said intervention by the police and the military is needed following cases of political violence in previous elections, a call that echoes appeals in other areas plagued by the presence of private armies. (READ: Bishop to Aquino: Stop Samar killings before polls)

A mayoral candidate in Albay's Malinao town – former Makati City engineer Nelson Morales – was gunned down by an alleged private armed group in 2012. It was the first known case of election violence in the 2013 midterm elections.

The presence of private armed groups are feared in the provinces of Masbate, Camarines Sur, and Camarines Norte. These areas have consistently been under tight watch.

Masbate was repeatedly placed under the control of the Commission on Elections because of election violence. In 1989, Masbate City Mayor Moises Espinosa was killed by alleged inmates and jail officers from the Masbate Provincial Jail. In 1991, Masbate Representative Jolly Fernandez was gunned down allegedly by inmates from the same correctional facility.

The region will be among the most-watched areas in the coming 2016 polls because of the participation of 4 Bicolano politicians in the vice presidential polls. It is a challenge for local politicians in the region that has been known for bloc voting for fellow Bicolanos.

Church efforts

Baylon has committed the local church's participation in educating Bicol voters and ensuring that the elections will be peaceful and orderly.

“We will organize these [activities] in every city and municipality in the province where candidates can come together, present their plans to the public, and debate on issues that matter to their respective communities,” he said.

The local Diocesan Commission on Social Concerns and Social Action Center also launched the PPCRV Albay-Election Operation and affirmed its commitment to assist Comelec.

PPCRV or the Parish Pastorical Council for Responsible Voting is the nationwide election watchdog organized by leaders of the Catholic Church. It establishes voters assistance desks and monitoring on election day. Volunteers are also deployed in polling centers to assist voters and board of election inspectors.

“Consistent with our HOPE (honest, orderly and peaceful elections) advocacy, we are campaigning against vote buying and selling, political dynasties, and election-related violence,"" Baylon said in a pastoral letter.

""We are also introducing grassroots communities to the concept of and venues for people’s participation in good governance,” he added.",16/10/2015,https://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/109441-bicol-armed-groups-election-violence
Surge of party list nominations expected on last day,,15/10/2015,https://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/109419-surge-party-list-nominations
Will De Lima be Senate's next Miriam Santiago?,"MANILA, Philippines – She was the dauntless head of the human rights commission and the justice department but does Leila de Lima have what it takes to be the next Senator Miriam Defensor Santiago?

De Lima raised the question as she formalized her Senate bid on Thursday, October 15. Her candidacy for the May 2016 polls marks the first time she is running for public office.

The former justice secretary known for ordering controversial investigations into corruption and criminal cases said people compare her to Santiago, the Senate's resident legal expert known as the Iron Lady of Asia.

“I am often asked if I will be the next Miriam Santiago of the Senate,” De Lima said. “How I wish, but I beg to disagree.”

“First, I have yet to win any election. Second, there is only one Miriam Defensor Santiago, and she cannot be replaced. But I will surely attempt to be a good student, and learn from the veteran of so many political battles.”

De Lima paid tribute to Santiago as she delivered the keynote address at the Philippine Judges Association conference at the Marriott Hotel in Pasay. City Santiago also attended the event, where she was inducted into the group's Hall of Fame. (READ: Miriam Santiago: Senators dream of becoming president)

The former justice secretary addressed the gathering before filing her senatorial candidacy at the Commission on Elections office in Manila.

De Lima said she is honored to be compared to the popular and multi-awarded Santiago.

“Senator Miriam is probably the first role model of a fearless lady public servant under the present 5th Republic of the Philippine nation. We can probably say that she is the one who started the tradition of strong women in government when she 'ate death threats for breakfast' as commissioner of immigration,” De Lima said in reference to a famous Santiago line.

While she praised Santiago, De Lima is supporting the candidacy of administration standard-bearer former interior secretary Manuel “Mar” Roxas II. Santiago is running for president, up against Roxas, opposition leader Vice President Jejomar Binay, and independent Senator Grace Poe.

De Lima, 56, resigned from the justice department last week to run for senator under the ruling Liberal Party's 12-member senatorial ticket.

She was one of the key women leaders in the Aquino government, along with Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno, Ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales, former Commission on Audit Chairperson Grace Pulido-Tan, and Internal Revenue Commissioner Kim Henares.

Also an 'uragon'
In her first speech as “citizen and candidate Leila,” De Lima outlined her plans for the Senate, focusing on the rule of law and fighting corruption.

“Ang rule of law ay ang paghahari ng batas at hindi tao (The rule of law is the reign of the law and not the person). We need a new offensive against corruption and the corrupt. We must strengthen mechanisms against ill-gotten wealth,” she said.

“'Di na puwedeng pairalin ang pagiging mabait sa mga kurakot sa bayan (We cannot be kind to the corrupt).Filipinos are forgiving and forgetful to a fault. The result is impunity,” De Lima added.

The former Cabinet member took pride in her department's investigation into the pork barrel corruption scam that sent top lawmakers to jail, the closure of illegal mining operations, and probe into price manipulation and cartels.

If she wins, De Lima said she will support two bills: the New Criminal Code, and the Criminal Investigation Act.

She drew loud applause from a crowd of judges and justices when she said she will push for a law giving them hazard pay, and permanent security details. Judges and justices have been gunned down in the course of their work.

In an interview, De Lima said she stands on her record as a former election lawyer, chairperson of the Commission on Human Rights, and justice secretary.

Like 4 vice presidential candidates, De Lima hails from the Bicol region, in Iriga, Camarines Sur. The 4 vice presidential candidates from Bicol are Senators Francis Escudero, Gregorio Honasan II, Antonio Trillanes IV, and Camarines Sur Representative Leni Robredo. The vaunted Bicol vote is expected to be divided among the 4.

De Lima said there are many “uragon,” a positive term referring to Bicolanos.

“It's a source of pride among Bicolanos that we have some personalities who are vying for the vice presidential position. I'd like to think that I can count on them in the same manner that they supported former and sitting senators,” she said.

De Lima is also banking on the backing of women, students, and professional groups like lawyers and judges.

The secretary said it was important to elect strong women leaders.

“That is certainly great for the country, women empowerment. Indeed our country is advanced compared to other countries and even in Asia. The Philippines has been gaining ground in terms of gender equality, women empowerment and the best proof is so many women now are vying for positions, even the highest post of the land,"" she said.

'INC sees I was doing my job'

De Lima said she will reach out to all types of voters, including members of the religious group Iglesia ni Cristo (INC).

She drew the ire of the politically influential INC when she ordered the investigation into allegations of kidnapping of expelled church members. In August, thousands of INC members held a 3-day protest stalling Metro Manila traffic to protest the move. The group holds sway in elections due to the bloc vote of its 1.37 million members. (READ: Why De Lima is a target of Iglesia ni Cristo's anger)

“I'd like to believe that by now, they understand my side. They have a perspective and so did I. It so happened we had different views. Maybe after two months, they see that I was just doing my job,” De Lima said.

The former secretary said she knows that she angered many people because of her work.

“The ultimate judge are really the sovereign voters, and so I just stand by my own persona. But do I have a choice? I shouldn't have accepted this post if I keep thinking about repercussions.”

She is now adjusting to being a senatorial candidate.

23 groups file nominations for party list,"MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – A total of 23 organizations filed their nomination and acceptance certificates for the party list as of Tuesday, October 13, before the Commission on Elections.

Around 200 groups earlier sought accreditation before the election commission this year. They are in addition to some 160 groups that have already been accredited in past elections.

The party list is a system of proportional representation meant to better represent marginalized sectors as well as groups lacking ""well-defined constituencies."" Republic Act 7941 or the Party-List System Act allocates 20% of the total seats in the House of Representatives to party-list representatives.

This week marks the filing of certificates of nominations and acceptance for party-list groups that are already accredited or have pending accreditation petitions.

The following groups have filed their respective manifestations of intent to participate in the 2016 polls, the equivalent of an individual's candidacy certificate:

ABS Partylist
ACT-CIS
Anakpawis
Butil Partylist
COOP NATCO
Mindanao Alliance for Reform (MAR)

Reversal of ruling

In 2013, the Supreme Court (SC) reversed its earlier ruling on the party-list system that participation was limited to those who belonged to the marginalized sectors.

In its analysis of the intent of the party-list law, the SC ruled that original intention of the law was to create a system of proportional representation for groups and parties of different kinds and not just the marginalized. The SC ruled that this interpretation was in keeping with the Constitution. (READ: SC shakes up party list in new verdict)

Organizations participating in the party list can now either represent the ""marginalized and underrepresented” or those who lack ""well-defined political constituencies.”

Sectors that lack “well-defined political constituencies” include professionals, the elderly, women, and the youth.

Marginalized and underrepresented sectors, on the other hand, include labor, peasant, fisherfolk, urban poor, indigenous cultural communities, handicapped, veterans, overseas workers, and other similar sectors.

With the 2013 ruling, nominees of party-list groups do not necessarily have to be from the sector they represent, as long as the nominees have a ""track record of advocacy for their respective sectors.""

This has opened the door to more traditional representatives or even politicians who claim to possess this track record to obtain a seat in Congress.",12/10/2015,https://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/109010-party-list-accreditation

VP bet Leni Robredo comes home to Naga,"NAGA CITY, Philippines – For the first time since she was declared the vice presidential bet of the Liberal Party, Congresswoman Leni Robredo came home to Naga City in Camarines Sur on Wednesday, October 7.

“Help me in this walk,” she told provincial, city, municipal, barangay leaders and supporters from all walks of life gathered at the Naga city hall covered court that afternoon.

Help me campaign not just in Camarines Sur, not just in the Bicol region, but across the country, through people you know, she told them.

“This fight is not the fight of our province or our region alone but of the Filipino people who believe in honest, transparent, good governance and leadership,” she said in the dialect. Behind her was a huge yellow tarpaulin that said, ""Laban Leni: Bikolano. Filipino. Pusong Robredo.""

It could very well be the Bicolanos’ fight. Robredo is one of the 3 or 4 politicians from the bloc-voting region who are running for vice president. She points out, however, that she’s the only one among them who was born, who grew up, and who studied in Bicol, specifically in Naga City.

It will be the fight of ordinary folks, of the neglected sectors, whose causes Robredo had championed over the years, even without the media’s attention. (READ: 8 things to know about Leni Robredo)

‘Louder voice in Malacañang’

Charlie Capresio, national president of a group representing fisherfolk, said he had witnessed Robredo’s help for the sector. She had provided legal services to fishermen in the 3rd district of Camarines Norte, and worked for infrastructure they needed most.

“In just two years of her incumbency, she looked after our needs. She built a dike that would protect us from natural disasters. That was long forgotten by previous leaders here,” he said.

He feels that Robredo would defend their rights against the powerful. “If she wins, we might have louder voices in the Malacañang,” Capresio said.

Ed Yu, spokesman for the regional office of the National Irrigation Administration, knows how Robredo personally checks on the needs of her constituents. She visits them as often as possible, even in far-flung areas, where it is necessary to walk long distances.

“[She travels] by foot even under the heat of the sun, without any protection like umbrella or a hat. She walks fast without any complaint for several hours. She doesn’t want special treatment. She eats whatever food is available in the villages,” Yu said.

“In just a span of two years, a lot of changes and development have been noted in her district. She’s a silent worker, not after the publicity. Many of our politicians went to areas with big crowds, but Congresswoman Leni is different. She usually goes to the outskirts, even without people accompanying her, to check out ongoing projects,” the NIA official said.

Just before she decided to accept the Liberal Party’s offer to be the running mate of Manuel “Mar” Roxas II, Robredo led the groundbreaking and turnover of P48.3-million worth of irrigation projects in Pili and Ocampo towns. The projects will irrigate 853 hectares and benefit at least 555 farmers.

Leni Robredo was just following the example of her late husband Jesse, longtime mayor of Naga, who went around in slippers, always accessible to his constituents, and planning and implementing programs with the people.

During those years, Leni was a practicing lawyer, representing women and other marginalized sectors for free.

Offer made on Peñafrancia feast day

In her speech, Robredo mentioned a date significant to any Catholic Bicolano.

She said Roxas offered to field her as running mate on September 19, on the feast day of Our Lady of Peñafrancia.“The post was offered to me on the feast day of Ina.”

This, she said in Bicolano, triggered all her prayers and may have finally made her daughters give their blessings to her vice presidential bid.

“Three days before the proclamation, which was set on Monday (October 5), my daughters finally gave me the green light. So, Sunday, I announced it to the brothers of my husband and to my family,” Robredo said.

Robredo said that when she accepted the offer, she thought that this might be her chance to do much more for the country, for her region that had long been neglected by leaders.

“This might be the time that attention is given to the Bicol region – to improve our railway system, to develop and establish our airports and road network,” she said.

“But I have a plea: that if you’re going to support me, please give your complete support to my president, Mar Roxas.”

She got that guarantee, at least from those who welcomed her home, at Naga’s city hall – they whom she considered “my strength aside from my family.”",10/10/2015,https://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/108766-vp-leni-robredo-comes-home-naga
Villafuertes back Grace Poe-Leni Robredo ticket,"NAGA CITY, Philippines – Camarines Sur Governor Miguel “Migz” Villafuerte and his father, former Governor Luis Raymund “LRay” Villafuerte, reiterated their support for the presidential bid of Senator Grace Poe, but clarified that the backing will not extend to her running mate, Senator Francis “Chiz” Escudero.

Instead the Villafuertes will support for vice president their province mate and ally, Camarines Sur 3rd District Representative Leni Robredo. (READ: Realignments start in Robredo's Camarines Sur)

“I’ll be frank. 'Though I have a heavy heart – because senators Antonio Trillanes, Bongbong Marcos, and Alan Peter Cayetano are my friends and mentors – I will be supporting the candidacy of my kababayan. We will support Leni Robredo. So it’s Grace and Leni in Camarines Sur,” the young governor said on Tuesday, October 6, during Poe's visit.

The Villafuertes invited Poe to grace the World Teacher’s Day celebration in Camarines Sur and meet the key political players in the province. The senator, in turn, expressed gratitude to the Villafuertes for embracing her candidacy. (READ: In Photos: Stars, politicians, ordinary folks turn up for Grace Poe)

It is not clear who the clan patriarch, former Representative Luis Villafuerte Sr, will be supporting. He had a falling out with his son and grandson in 2013, and fielded his wife against Robredo then.

Camarines Sur has the biggest voters' population among the 6 provinces in the Bicol region – 40% of the region's voters – followed by Albay.

“I will do everything to make Poe win in Camarines Sur,” Governor Villafuerte said.

He said 24 out of 35 municipal mayors in the province are supporting Poe's candidacy against Robredo's standard-bearer, the Liberal Party's Manuel Roxas II.

Miguel and LRay belong to the Nacionalista Party, while Poe is an independent who is awaiting the endorsement of the Nacionalist People's Coalition.

'Gifted people'

Speaking before a crowd of around 12,000, composed mostly of public school teachers and political supporters at Jesse M. Robredo Coliseum, Poe said she admired for having remarkable and intelligent political leaders with untainted reputations.

She cited as examples the late Senator Raul Roco and the late Interior Secretary Jesse Robredo, husband of the Liberal Party's vice presidential candidate.

“Bicol is gifted with intelligent people and political leaders like late senator Raul Roco and late DILG Secretary Jess Robredo. That’s why today 4 of the vice presidentiables are Bicolano senators: Chiz Escudero, my running mate, Antonio Trillanes, Gregorio Honasan, and Representative Leni Robredo,” Poe said. (READ: Bicol: A 'cradle' of VP candidates)

Although she acknowledged that the famed Bicol bloc vote will be divided now, Poe said it was good that voters are being given many options. She nevertheless pushed for Escudero, who is from Sorsogon.

“For me, we’re giving our people the opportunity to choose. Senator Chiz, I think, has proven himself. Then Congresswoman Leni Robredo is also a capable candidate. Senator Antonio Trillanes has also proven his competence, then Senator Gringo Honasan,” she said.

Bicol a ‘cradle’ of VP candidates,"MANILA, Philippines – With Camarines Sur Representative Leni Robredo formally announcing her bid for the vice presidency, Senate President Pro-Tempore Ralph Recto said that the Bicol region is becoming a “cradle” of vice presidential candidates.

“Sa unang pagkakataon, mas maraming ‘vice presidentiable’ na magmumula sa Bicol sa taong ito kesa sa bagyo,” said Recto in a statement on Monday, October 5, making references to the Bicol's location as a typhoon belt. (For the first time, there are more vice presidential candidates than typhoons coming from Bicol this year.)

""It is becoming the cradle of VPs. National leaders are becoming its major export. Bicol is punching above its weight,” the senator added.

On Monday morning, Robredo ended the weeks-long courtship of the Liberal Party (LP) by declaring that she will be the running mate of the party’s standard-bearer, Manuel “Mar” Roxas II.

Before throwing her hat into local politics, Robredo took over as LP’s chairman in Camarines Sur following the death of her husband, former Interior Secretary Jesse Robredo, in August 2012.

She then ran for Congress in 2013 as LP members believed only Robredo’s candidacy could topple the influential Villafuerte dynasty in Camarines Sur’s 3rd district.

Senator Antonio “Sonny” Trillanes IV, who formally announced on Saturday that he will run for vice president, hails from Albay, where his late father grew up. The senator and his group Magdalo will be supporting the presidential bid of Senator Grace Poe.

Poe’s running mate, Senator Francis “Chiz” Escudero, also comes from Bicol. He was a former representative of Sorsogon, where his father, former Agriculture Secretary Salvador “Tatay” Escudero, was a veteran politician.

Meanwhile, Senator Gringo Honasan II, another Bicol native, is expected to accept the offer to be the vice presidential candidate of his party, the United Nationalist Alliance. He will be the running mate of Vice President Jejomar Binay.

“If Gringo will join the fray, Leni will be the 4th Bicolano to throw her hat into the vice presidential ring. Batangueno Sonny Trillanes’ mom is from Bicol, which makes him an oragon,” said Recto, using a Bicolano slang word referring to a person of excellence and someone who is feisty and brave.

“Like a sili (chili), the presence of Bicol stalwarts will add spice to the vice presidential contest. As they share the same homeland, I foresee a friendly but fierce contest among kababayans (those coming from the same region).”

The 'age' of Bicolanos

This is the first time in the country’s political history wherein Bicolanos have been chosen by various presidential aspirants as their running mates.

The Bicol region, commonly known as opposition country, is noted for its bloc voting history with more than 3 million registered voters as of July 2015.

Escudero, Honasan, Robredo, and Trillanes will be facing Senator Alan Peter Cayetano, who is eyeing a tandem with Davao Mayor Rodrigo Duterte, and Senator Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr, who announced late Monday that he will run for vice president too.

Cayetano is an adopted Albayano because his wife, Taguig Mayor Lani Cayetano, is a native of Tiwi town in Albay.

“It means this is the age of Bicolanos,” said Honasan.

Trillanes, meanwhile, thinks having Bicolanos as vice presidential candidates is good for the region.

“Ano man ang mangyari, maganda ito [para] sa Bicol region dahil mayroon at maroon mananalo from the region at hopefully this time, mabibigyan na talaga ng attention ang Bicol region para ‘di na siya napagiiwanan,” he said.

(Whatever happens, this is good for the Bicol region because it’s likely that someone will win from the region for vice president. Hopefully this time, due attention would be given to the Bicol region so it will not be left behind.)

Good luck

Why Leni Robredo is Mar Roxas' choice,"SORSOGON, Philippines – Is administration bet Manuel Roxas II one step closer to finally finding a running mate?

Roxas formally offered the slot to Camarines Sur Representative Maria Leonor “Leni” Robredo during a visit to Naga City on Friday, September 18.

Robredo confirmed the offer in a chance interview with reporters in Naga City, and said she would be mulling it over.

The offer came two days after Senator Grace Poe, whom Roxas and the ruling Liberal Party had been publicly wooing to be his vice president, announced her own bid for the presidency.

And it came a day after Senator Francis ""Chiz"" Escudero, who is from Bicol like Robredo, announced his vice-presidential bid.

Roxas confirmed that the ""informal and formal"" processes in offering the vice presidential slot to Robredo have begun. ""May sinusunod tayo na pormal na proseso na pormal na rin na inihain kay Cong Leni at hindi ko naman gustong pangunahan yung proseso,"" he told reporters in Sorsogon.

September 16 decision

The decision to formally offer the post to Robredo was made on Wednesday night, September 16, during a meeting called by President Benigno Aquino III with Roxas and other senior party officials, Rappler learned.

The meeting was held on the night Poe declared her presidential bid.

Robredo was informed about what was discussed in the meeting, according to a source close to LP.

The following day, Thursday, September 17, Robredo posted a picture of her husband, the late Interior Secretary Jesse Robredo, on her Facebook account, asking for a “lifeline.” Supporters flooded the comments section of the post, egging on Robredo to run. (READ: Netizens react to Roxas' offer to Robredo)

When we checked Friday, the Facebook post has been deleted.

Aquino, who led the public wooing of Poe, has been the one pushing hard for a Roxas-Robredo tandem, the same source added.

So that even before Poe's announcement, talks between the two camps had already begun – even if in public, Roxas and Aquino were saying they were still “hopeful” about Poe.

Poe would’ve ensured that the broad coalition led by the LP, which includes the Nacionalista Party (NP), Nationalist People’s Coalition (NPC) and the National Unity Party (NUP) would stay intact come 2016.

But that ship has long sailed.

Why Leni?

The Roxas camp had another choice for running mate: Senator Alan Peter Cayetano. (READ: Who will be Mar Roxas' VP? List: Poe, Robredo, Cayetano)

A power bloc in the Roxas camp has been pushing for the senator to be the standard-bearer's running mate. Cayetano himself said he was open to it.

But Cayetano carries some baggage. He was with the camp of former Senator Manuel Villar, who ran against Aquino in the 2010 presidential race. A member of the NP, Cayetano is also believed to have been among those who orchestrated the release of a fake medical report during the 2010 elections, which alleged Aquino had psychological issues. Cayetano also demonized the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, which signed a peace agreement with the Aquino government, at the height of the Masamapano scandal.

In contrast, Robredo has always been identified with the Aquino administration. Her husband, a good friend of Roxas, ran the first phase of Aquino's presidential campaign. She is also a staunch supporter of the peace process with the MILF.

Supporters of Roxas see Robredo as the embodiment of the government’s “Daang Matuwid,” or its transparency, good governance, and anti-corruption platform.

The late Jesse Robredo is remembered for his work in Naga City, where he introduced reforms that turned the city from a laggard to among the most distinguished in the country.

Daughters opposed to VP bid

Prior to joining politics, Leni Robredo was a lawyer who took on cases for the city’s poor. This is among the reasons, Roxas said in a past interview, why she is among his choices for vice president.

“She has the experience, she’s a lawyer. When she was a lawyer, she didn’t use her knowledge to represent companies. Instead, she helped people from Naga and she was a lawyer for the poor, those who could not afford legal representation. When it comes to helping our countrymen, her track record is well established,” Roxas said.

Robredo is also the LP’s chairman in Bicol.

Robredo has said the vice presidency is “not an option” for her since it was “too soon.”

She was elected representative of the 3rd district of Camarines Sur in 2013, a year after her husband’s tragic death in a plane crash.

Her 3 daughters are also against her running for the VP post, according to Robredo herself. At most, she said in the past, she is eyeing a Senate post.

“There are a lot of options – people who are more qualified. I don’t have a monopoly on good intentions. I’m aware of my limitations, I’m realistic about my targets,” Robredo earlier told reporters.

Awareness numbers are also a concern for Robredo, although she has been going around the country in the past few weeks.

Who will take her place?

But among the biggest factors, at least politically, is the district she would be leaving behind should she run for vice president.

Robredo had not planned to run for Congress in 2013 but was convinced by the clamor of locals who wanted a viable candidate against the Villafuertes, a politically entrenched family in the province.

Robredo defeated Nelly Villafuerte in the 2013 polls. (READ: Robredo: I'm the example of how votes can't be bought)

The Villafuertes are related to Robredo’s late husband, although the two had a falling out when the former Naga mayor refused to heed his relatives’ requests.

Robredo's vice-presidential bid would make the Camarines Sur district open again to the Villafuertes.

The patriarch, former Camarines Sur Representative Luis Villafurter, is said to be eyeing a comeback. His grandson is the incumbent governor of the province.

The Villafuertes are now supporting Poe and were seen during Poe's declaration at UP.

Current Naga City councilor Gabriel Bordado Jr. is being eyed as a possible replacement for Robredo. Bordado was vice mayor when Jesse Robredo was mayor of Naga.

Splitting Bicol vote

And there's the problem of ""splitting"" the Bicol vote.

""As a party man, I'll go for [Leni Robredo]. But this division is something that Bicol doesn't need,"" Albay Governor Joey Salceda told Rappler in a phone interview.

Escudero, Poe's running mate, was representative of Sorsogon prior to joining the Senate. The senator’s father was once Sorsogon’s representative in Congress, a position now being held by his mother.

Robredo also happens to trace her roots, through her father’s side, to Sorsogon.

""It will divide Bicol and a divided Bicol is not important to the next administration. It is a division that Bicol doesn't need at all,"" said Salceda.

The governor noted that should Robredo decide to seek the vice presidency, it would be the first time for Bicol to have its politicians directly run against each other in a national race.

But we note that it would also be the first time in recent history for Bicol to have a fighting chance to make one of its own vice president. ",18/09/2015,https://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/106330-leni-robredo-mar-roxas-vice-president-choice
Legaspi Int'l Airport completes P40M upgrade,"MANILA, Philippines –The P40-million ($857,916.48) Legaspi International Airport passenger terminal refurbishment is complete, the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) announced Thursday, August 20.

The new terminal building is expected to accommodate more than 500 passengers at any time.

The airport currently handles 8 regular flights from Manila and Cebu from Philippine Airlines, Cebu Pacific, and CebGo (Tiger Air); and chartered international flights mostly from Shanghai and mainland China. It accommodates medium-sized commercial jets and military aircraft on its single runway.

The airport can handle night landings and take-off but only on prior notice. It normally operates from sunrise to sunset due to the ongoing improvement and installation of its instrument landing system.

The newly renovated passenger terminal building (PTB) was designed to provide convenience to airline passengers. Its eco-friendly design also features ceiling glass fronted walls, which allows sunlight to fill the facility that reduced the need for artificial lighting for the good part of the day.

It also provides a view of the runway, and the Mayon Volcano.

Separate international arrival and pre-departure areas were added in the refurbished PTB. There are spaces now housing government agencies like the Bureau of Immigration, Customs and H uman/Plant Quarantine, and Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency.

CAAP's self-generated revenue provided funds that allowed improvements on Legaspi International Airport's passenger terminal. The construction of the South Luzon or Bicol International Airport is underway and eyed for completion in the next 5 years. (READ: DOTC earmarks P781M for Bicol international airport)

“The management could not just sit and watch with a blank face the difficulties and discomfort being experienced by passengers due to cramped space and insufficient vent system of the old passenger terminal,” said Cynthia Tumanut, area and airport manager of the Area Center V and Legaspi International Airport.

"Volcanic ash help stem red tide bloom in Bicol waters, says scientist","LEGAZPI CITY, Philippines – Volcanic ash might be a big problem during eruptions, but a scientist says it can help minimize a different problem – red tide.

The Philippines' fishing grounds is in dismal situation, as high levels of chemical contamination and harmful algae now affect almost all major fishing grounds in the country, says marine scientist Ronnel Dioneda, the director of the Bicol University Research and Development Center–Higher Education Regional Research Center

Dioned said that an increasing number of fishing grounds in the country is becoming more toxic, with the spread becoming more frequent and intense.

“More fishing grounds in the country are contaminated with chemicals [increasing the] toxicity of oceans... The serious threat is to human health, decimating aquaculture, and... to tourism too,” he said.

Dioneda said harmful algal bloom (HAB), known as the ""red tide"" toxin, is now affecting fishing grounds across the country. He cited the case of Sorsogon Bay when the red tide toxin was in bloom from September 2006 to July 2011. In this incident, contaminated shellfish caused the deaths of 20 people and the hospitalization of more than 300 others.

The dinoflagellate toxin is dangerous to public health, and it affects the livelihood of people who are dependent on shellfish, the marine scientist said.

In Sorsogon, the presence of red tide was temporarily contained after volcanic ash spewed by Mayon and Bulusan volcanoes flowed down to Sorsogon Bay.

Dioneda, who conducted a series of studies in Sorsogon Bay and other red tide-affected waters in Bicol, said the ash – rich in sulphur, silica and iron – indirectly helped curtail the toxin as these minerals encourage the proliferation of diatoms, microscopic algae that prevent the growth of dinoflagellates, which produce the red tide toxin.

He explained that diatoms are plankton that control the prevalence of the red tide agents. The diatoms, according to him, appear to benefit from the silica and other minerals more than the HAB-causing dinoflagellates. With an abundance of diatoms, the poisonous group of microorganisms are prevented from multiplying.

He explained that the cysts of dinoflagellates lay dormant on the ocean floor or buried on the sediment and left undisturbed and they can stay in this state for years.

Dioneda uncovered that there are rivers from Mayon Volcano in Albay that traverse Donsol and Pilar towns down to Sorsogon Bay, where a considerable amount of silica can be traced in the mouth of Sorsogon Bay.

“Volcanic materials, once dissolved in sea water, kills the cell with high density of toxicity,” he said. He said the decline in the red tide-producing microorganisms was noted after Bulusan spewed ash in 2011.

“Somehow, the volcanoes eruptions (Mayon and Bulusan) also help out to bring back the livelihood of the people specifically for tahong mussels’ dependent source of living,"" he added.",12/07/2015,https://www.rappler.com/science-nature/environment/98504-bicol-volcanoes-ash-red-tide
Bicol University grad tops 2 board exams,"ALBAY, Philippines – On the night the results of the May 2015 nursing board licensure examination was released, Benedict Rey Montas Serrano, 20, got a call from his girlfriend Shiena Mae Atienza. She passed.

She was more excited over another thing that Tuesday night, June 23: Benedict topped the board exams. He didn’t believe her.

“Bawal mag-joke (Don’t kid me),” he told her. The girlfriend hung up on him.

Benedict Serrano only realized it was true when the coordinator of the nursing review center in Legazpi City also called him, and “numerous congratulatory text messages and calls” started pouring in.

“That’s the only time I took the messages seriously,” he said.

He got a score of 86.40%, the highest among 17,981 total examinees, 9,707 of whom passed.

Serrano had reason to be a bit skeptical at first. What are the odds he would top another licensure exam? In 2013, he topped the midwifery examination.

A consistent honors student since grade school, Serrano is now in medical school, also at the Bicol University, where he also graduated from the nursing school cum laude this year.

Serrano is the oldest of 3 children of Dennis and Teodora, both 47 and mathematics teachers at the Pagasa National High School in Legazpi City. His sister Cathy Rose is studying accountancy at the Bicol University, and his brother Lawrence Rex is a Grade IV pupil at Tamauyan Elementary School.

Serrano prepared even before and beyond the six-month review course for the nursing board exams. “Early preparation and advance study greatly helped me out. I aimed at being number one, but the exam was quite difficult, I just prayed to pass it,” he said.

Six other graduates of Bicol University made it to the top 10:

Mount Bulusan spews ash,"LEGAZPI CITY, Philippines (UPDATED) – Stronger explosions in Sorsogon's Mount Bulusan are possible in the coming days, a government scientist said Tuesday, June 16, after successive ash explosions in the volcano.

On Tuesday, Bulusan volcano spewed at 11:02 am with clouds as high as 400 meters. The explosion, according to Phivolcs volcanologist Ed Laguerta, was bigger than the previous eruption last month.

The ashfall affected the volcano's southwest quadrant portion, specifically the municipalities of Juban and Irosin.


When asked if the series of phreatic explosions is a precursor for a bigger eruption, Laguerta said that if change in the chemical composition happens, stronger volcanic activity is likely to take place.

“Should the chemical composition [of the volcano's emissions] change, this might [indicate] a stronger volcanic activity,” Laguerta said.

Bulusan is one of the country’s most active volcanoes. Last month, the volcano exploded twice, first on May 1 and then on May 6.

Bulusan's explosions are usually phreatic or steam-driven, which is what occurred Tuesday. The last magmatic explosion occurred 40 years ago.

The volcano is under Alert Level 1 after a series of explosions last month, due to hydrothermal abnormalities beneath the volcano.

Phivolcs warned the public and disaster officials to be on guard around the clock for more steam-driven or phreatic eruptions in the coming days.

Col. Ceasar Idio, commanding officer of the Army’s 903rd Brigade, said military trucks are on standby for possible evacuation of residents living in the slopes of restive volcano.

“My men belonging from disaster response units are on alert and ready to respond for possible evacuation of the residents living in danger zone,” Idio said.

Phivolcs warned the public not to venture within the 4-kilometer danger zone as explosions may happen anytime. ",16/06/2015,https://www.rappler.com/nation/96520-mount-bulusan-spews-ash
Bicol LGUs to use social media in disaster response,"MANILA, Philippines – Local officials and advocacy groups in the Bicol region are now ready to maximize social media tools in their disaster risk reduction and management (DRRM) efforts.

A total of 116 participants – mostly from the provincial and municipal DRRM councils – underwent a workshop under Project Agos of the Move, the citizen engagement arm of Rappler, at the CBD Plaza Hotel in Naga City, Camarines Sur, June 4-5.

During the workshop, Rappler Research & Content Strategy head Gemma Bagayaua-Mendoza and Jed Alegado and Lou Gepuela of Project Agos discussed how social media can be used as a means to improve DRRM activities at the community level.

Participants received training on how to use Facebook and Twitter for information dissemination. They were also taught how to make use of innovative online platforms like the Project Agos Alert Map.

Project Agos also encouraged participants to have a mindset of achieving #ZeroCasualty in times of disaster.

Social media is a vital communication channel, according to engineer Domingo Ramos, a member of the staff for operation of the municipal DRRM office in the 2nd district of Pasacao, Camarines Sur.

""'Yung Facebook, 'yung Twitter, talagang important 'yun sa communication, lalo na kung may mga picture [kang ilalagay] para [mapakita] mo talaga kung ano 'yung nangyari,"" said Ramos.

(Facebook and Twitter are very important in communication, especially when you include photos in your posts so you can show people what really happened.)

Representatives from other local government units and groups shared the sentiment, and vowed to include the improved utilization of social media channels in their DRRM activities.

Edgar Balidoy from the municipal DRRM office in Sto Domingo said their office already has a Facebook account, which they would update with the latest weather bulletins and DRRM efforts.

However, he said, he will also make a Twitter profile for the office and request for a faster Internet connection, as suggested during the workshop.

“This will surely be an added warning and communication feature in our DRMM operations,” Balidoy said.

He added: ""Very important itong mga technology na 'to, especially sa warning, kasi ang aming [purpose ay] zero casualty."" (These forms of technology are very important, especially when warning people about incoming disasters, because our purpose is zero casualty.)

The Bicol region is considered as one of the most disaster-prone areas in the country. The region is often visited by typhoons and is home to two active volcanoes: Mount Mayon in Albay and Mount Bulusan in Sorsogon.

Those who attended the workshop were from towns and cities in Camarines Sur, Sorsogon, Albay, and Masbate. There were also delegates from the Department of the Interior and Local Government's RAY (Recovery Assistance for Yolanda) project.

Community outreach and disaster response offices of the Ateneo de Naga University and the Central Bicol State University of Agriculture also attended. Socio-civic groups – such as the Center for Bicol Development, DRR Net Philippines, and Kabalikat Civic Radio – also participated.
This workshop in Naga is part of Project Agos’ efforts to conduct capacity building workshops for various LGUs around the country. The first was held in Metro Manila in 2014.

MANAGING INFORMATION. A participant from the Project Agos Metro Manila Workshop explains the flow of information during a disaster response.

How can local government units in the Bicol region use social media and technology in preparing and responding to disasters?

This is the question that Project Agos seeks to answer through a capacity building workshop for disaster managers and disaster responders. The workshop, to be held at the CBD Hotel on June 4-5 2015, is aimed at building the capacity of local government officials, civil society organizations, and other stakeholders to use social media for disaster information management.

Seventeen barangays spread across 4 towns of Pampanga are identified as geo-hazard areas according to the Mines and Geosciences Bureau (MGB).

Furthermore, 26 municipalities are at high risk for flooding while 14 towns are highly susceptible to landslides.

Aiming for #ZeroCasualty

The event - to be attended by local executives, disaster managers and representatives of civil society in the Bicol Region, will highlight how social media can be used as a tool to improve disaster preparedness and response at the community level.

The workshop participants will receive training on how to use social media tools like Twitter and Facebook as well as how to use innovative online platforms like Project Agos. It aims to develop the mindset of achieving #ZeroCasualty in times of disasters.

GMA job cuts to include headquarters?,"MANILA, Philippines – After laying off employees in its regional offices, GMA Network, Incorporated said it will likely continue the process in its headquarters in Quezon City to reduce operational costs and ensure competitiveness.

“We’re done with regional offices, but here in the main office, we still have to know by how many; we’re constantly reviewing,” GMA President and Chief Executive Officer Felipe Gozon told reporters in a briefing Thursday, May 14 when asked if its manpower reduction program is still ongoing.

In April, contracts of workers in GMA-7’s regional offices in Cagayan de Oro, Bacolod, and two other cities were terminated. Some reports said this involved the sacking of at least a hundred reporters, video cameramen, and drivers who were an essential part of the network's newsgathering team.

Gozon, however, did not say how many were laid off in its regional stations and how much did the network save as a result.

Continuing process

Asked if the same will happen to its Manila office, the chief of GMA-7 replied: “It’s a continuing process,” noting that the company “will save millions of pesos” due to lower overhead cost.

Gozon said that his network gained “big savings” from the layoffs in regional stations.

“Lugi kami eh. Wala nang ratings eh. In short, wala nang silbi. Lahat naman ng managers ay ginagawa ito. Kung hahayaan mo lang, eh ‘di maba-bankrupt ka. (We were losing money. Ratings were low. In short, there’s no use. All managers do this. If you let this happen, you’ll be bankrupt),” he explained.

In a statement in April, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP) regarded the network's claim of ""strategic streamlining"" to justify the layoffs as a ""play on words"" that ""belies the grim reality that almost all employees in regional news desks of the network will lose their jobs.""

NUJP said the network ""is not on the brink of bankruptcy with no recourse but to let go of its employees to stay afloat.""

Under the Constitution, workers are guaranteed security of tenure or the right against termination without just cause and due process.

In 2014, GMA saw its bottom line shrink by 40% to P1.01 billion ($22.67 million) due to the lack of political advertisements that lifted its income a year before, during the 2013 elections.

But in the first quarter of the year, its net income jumped 25% to P408 million ($9.15 million), from P326 million ($7.31 million) a year ago.

Its revenues also went up by 5% to P3.01 billion ($67.50 million) from P2.85 billion ($63.91 million).

The chief of the country’s second largest broadcaster by market value said: “Our performance in the first quarter is a good indication that 2015 will be a much better year for our company.” ",15/05/2015,https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/172-telecommunications-media/93255-gma-network-staff-reduction-continues
Thousands evacuated in Sorsogon as Dodong nears,"LEGAZPI CITY, Philippines – Provincial authorities began on Friday, May 8, the mandatory pre-emptive evacuation of 2,000 families who have refused to leave their homes at the foot of Mount Bulusan in Sorsogon, in preparation for Typhoon Dodong (Noul).

The Office of Civil Defense Bicol (OCD5) and the Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council in Sorsogon began the task Friday afternoon in Cogon village and Irosin town.

Bernardo Rafaelito Alejandro, OCD5 director and Regional Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council chairman, said the pre-emptive evacuation of the families, numbering an estimated 11,000 people, is necessary to ensure their safety as the typhoon nears the country.

Disaster management authorities have expressed concern that expected heavy rains due to Dodong would mobilize the volcanic debris spewed by Bulusan last week and trigger lahar (mudlflows). Sorsogon is currently under public storm warning signal number 1.

'No choice'

On Friday, round 500 residents of farming villages around Bulusan, many of them children and elderly women, were seen boarding army trucks clutching sleeping mats and bags of clothes as Dodong bore down on the area.

""I have no choice but to evacuate. I may not be strong enough to outrun the mudflows,"" 66-year-old housewife Dolores Guela told Agence France-Presse.

The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) has raised Alert Level 1 over Bulusan after it erupted twice in less than a week – on May 1, and on May 6, spewing ash at least 250 meters high. (READ: Mount Bulusan in Sorsogon erupts again)

Minor ash explosions alone would not normally prompt an evacuation, but authorities ordered one nonetheless because of the threat of mudflows from the approaching storm.

At least 4,430 passengers are stranded in various ports of the Bicol region due to Dodong. The Philippine Ports Authority in Bicol has grounded all sea crafts in 7 ports.

Aside from Sorsogion, the provinces of Albay, Catanduanes, Camarines Sur, and Camarines Norte have also been placed under public storm signal number 1. ",08/05/2015,https://www.rappler.com/nation/92595-preemptive-evacuation-mount-bulusan-dodong
Sorsogon towns evacuate residents ahead of multi-hazards,"SORSOGON, Philippines – Disaster management authorities in the towns of Irosin and Juban in Sorsogon province evacuated more than 1,000 people on Thursday, May 7, amid the twin threats of a pending volcanic eruption and an approaching typhoon.

Government volcanologists raised the alert level on Mount Bulusan in Sorsogon early Thursday after the volcano, one of the most active in the Philippines, erupted twice in a week.

The weather bureau, meanwhile, said it expected to raise Storm Signal No. 1 over Sorsogon and 3 other provinces in the Bicol region by 11 pm of Thursday.

On Wednesday night, after Bulusan erupted a second time in a week, some residents around the volcano already fled their houses.

Director Renato Solidum of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) warned that a series of explosions is possible for Bulusan, and that lahar from its slopes might remobilize in the low lying areas following the threat of intense rainfall expected toward the weekend.

The ashes emitted by Bulusan fell on the volcano's southwest quadrant, particularly on the towns of Juban and Irosin. Traces of ash were observed in Sitio Tulay of Barangay Bagsangan, Cogon, Monbon, and Tinampo in the municipality of Irosin.

Solidum explained that steam-driven eruptions, called ""phreatic"" eruptions, occur when water makes contact with hot rock inside the volcano causing steam.

“Due to pressure build-up, the steam escapes through the crater explosively. Such explosions are typical to Bulusan during restive periods, when its hydrothermal system is disturbed or when steam accumulates and pressurizes at the shallow levels of the volcanic edifice,” Solidum said.

This indicates that hydrothermal processes may be underway beneath the volcano that may lead to more steam-driven eruptions.

To ensure the safety of the public, Phivolcs strictly warned local government units and the public not to enter the 4-kilometer radius Permanent Danger Zone (PDZ). There is a possibility of sudden and hazardous steam-driven or phreatic eruptions in the coming days, it said.

Phivolcs also told civil aviation authorities to advise pilots to avoid flying close to the volcano’s summit, as ash from any sudden phreatic eruption can be hazardous to aircraft.

Mount Bulusan is one of the active volcanoes in the country. Sometime between 2005 and 2006, the two active volcanoes in the Bicol region – Bulusan in Sorsogon and Mayon in neighboring Albay province – both became restive and erupted.

Currently, Mount Mayon is on alert level 2 and may erupt anytime once magma shoots up toward the crater rim. Phivolcs scientists are closely watching both volcanoes. ",07/05/2015,https://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/disasters/92474-sorsogon-towns-evacuate-residents-ahead-multi-hazards
Gov't to bid out Phase 2 of North-South rail project in May,"MANILA, Philippines – The government will start looking for a private partner that will help build its biggest railway project thus far: the P287-billion ($6.43-billion) North-South Commuter Railway (NSCR).
Michael Arthur Sagcal, spokesperson of the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC), said in a text message that his department plans to bid out the public-private partnership (PPP) component or Phase 2 of the NSCR project this month.

Phase 2 of NSCR will involve commuter lines connecting Tutuban to the southern peripheries of Metro Manila and a long-haul network to the Bicol provinces. This phase will also include an initial terminus in Legazpi City and a branch line eventually connecting Matnog in Sorsogon.

This was after the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Board approved the rollout of the Phase 2 of the NSCR in February. This PPP component has a project cost of P170.7 billion ($3.82 billion).

“DOTC is targeting to award the project during the first quarter of 2016 and start its construction by 2017,” Sagcal said in his text message.

“We then hope to start operations of NSCR by 2021,” Sagcal said.

Meanwhile, the first phase of the NSCR or the Malolos-Tutuban line is “targeted to be operational in the third quarter of 2020,” DOTC Secretary Joseph Emilio Abaya said in January.

The first phase of the railway project will “involve the construction of a 36.7-kilometer elevated commuter railway from Malolos, Bulacan to Tutuban, Manila. The project cost of this NSCR component is P117 billion ($2.62 billion), Abaya said.

The government said it plans to start the construction of the NSCR's Phase 1 ""in the first quarter of 2017 and end in the third quarter of 2020,"" the Transportation chief said.

The first phase of NSCR is being studied as an official development assistance (ODA)-funded project, though funding out of the National Budget is also an option.

“Initially, there is a (Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) proposal to do it through ODA funding. So we’ve been instructed to talk to JICA; but... the government has the option to finance the project through the National Budget; we think it would be the fastest way,” Abaya said.

Once it becomes operational, the average daily ridership for the Malolos-Tutuban line or the Phase 1 is estimated at 340,000 passengers.

“For a mega city like Manila, it is clearly a consequence of a growing economy is the growing capacity of our people to own their own vehicles -- clearly, with our traffic that is not the way to go,” Abaya told reporters last January.

“And the solution to that natural tendency is to develop mass transit systems. Thus government is investing in rails, in BRTs (bus rapid transits), likewise reforming the bus system,” he added.",07/05/2015,https://www.rappler.com/business/industries/208-infrastructure/92421-north-south-railway-ppp-bid
Runner from Bicol Region wins first Palaro gold medal,"TAGUM CITY, Philippines – April Boy Adricula from Bicol Region gets his first gold medal after outrunning Calabarzon's Daryl Fabricante in the 2015 Palarong Pambansa boys elementary 110-meter hurdles.

Adricula and Fabricante were even through the first 7 hurdles before the 13-year-old Bicolano pulled away to victory with a tally of 17.52 seconds – an improvement from his 4th place finish during the 2014 Palaro in Laguna.

Fabricante settled for second place as he ended with a tally of 17.60 seconds.

""Masaya ako na nanalo ako. Makakatulong sa mga magulang ko ang perang makukuha ko dahil sa panalong ito,"" said Adricula, a fisherman's son from Libmanan, Camarines Sur.

(I'm happy I won. I can help my parents with the money I will get for winning.)

""Nagpursige po talaga ako manalo at sa tulong ng mga tao sa paligid ko, mag-uuwi ako ng isang gold sa probinsya namin.""

(I really persevered to win, and with the help of the people around me, I will bring home a gold to my province.)

The grade 5 student from Sogod Elementary School failed to net a medal in his first two events, the Triple Jump and 4x100 meter Relay.

Despite the first two defeats, Adricula never thought of withdrawing and went on to conquer one of his dreams: to be a Palaro champ.

""Inspirasyon ko yung pamilya ko at sa tulong ng Diyos, nakuha ko ang tagumpay na ito,"" he added.

(My family serves as my inspiration, and with the help of God, I achieved this victory.)

The Bicolano runner will be competing in the 4x400 meter Relay in hopes of winning another gold medal for his region.

Rico Jay Lacson, another runner from the Bicol Region, also edged National Capital Region's Kharl Berjuela to win the bronze in the same event within 17.90 seconds.

CAR dominates in men's HS wrestling,"TAGUM CITY, Philippines – As high as the highlands of Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) was the elation of the region's wrestlers as they ruled the boys secondary wrestling with two gold medals, one silver, and one bronze on Wednesday, May 6, at Tagum Fundamental Baptist Church Gym.

Defying the excruciating pain of grappling and attempted pins, CAR's Ruzzel Tuguinay won over Eastern Visayas' Francisco Arca by maintaining superior position after performing multiple rolls in the 42 kg weight class.

Nathaniel Gullunan added to the gold tally as he won by pinfall in the 58 kg weight class. Kenneth Mang-uhan and Jess Nyolab also showed their prowess in joint locks and pins by winning silver and bronze in 46 kg and 50 kg weight classes, respectively.

""Iyong fast feet nila at mahusay na technique ang nagpapanalo sa kanila. Isa narin doon ang disiplina na tinataglay nila (Their fast feet and good technique made them win the game. Their discipline also helped),"" CAR wrestling trainer Eliong Gamboc said in an interview after the awarding ceremony.

Gamboc does not consider this victory as an overnight miracle since their team had to adjust to the hot weather of Davao del Norte by arriving one week before the Palaro games commenced.

""I even spent my own money to finance the expenses incurred in the training since the financial support is not enough,"" said Gamboc, adding that their victory is worth all the efforts and sacrifices.

NCR's lone gold

First-timer Jason Cater grabbed the only gold for the National Capital Region (NCR) by slaughtering Mang-uhan from CAR with a pitfall in the second round of the 46 kg weight class championship match.

Determined to maintain the spot in next year's Palarong Pambansa, Cater vowed to replicate his perseverance in going through the gruelling training which starts as early as 4 am daily, and involves other investments like enough rest and proper diet.

""Sulit talaga ang weight loss ko. Halos mamatay na nga ako sa gutom dahil six days akong walang kanin na kinakain (My weight loss paid off. I almost died from hunger because I did not eat rice for six days),"" Cater said.

Now that he successfully passed through the eye of the needle, Cater encouraged his female counterparts to strive hard and bring NCR's banner to the peak as they compete in the girls secondary wrestling match on Thursday, May 7.

Out of the 8 regions that sent delegations to wrestling competitions, Visayas regions also asserted their share of victory as Eastern Visayas sealed one gold, one silver and two bronze medals, while Western Visayas won one gold, one silver and two bronze medals.

The host Davao Region seized two silver and two bronze medals, while Bicol Region won 3 bronze medals.

Mount Bulusan in Sorsogon erupts again,"MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Mount Bulusan in Sorsogon erupted again on Wednesday, May 6 at around 9:46 pm. According to the Office of Civil Defense in Bicol, the mountain is spewing ash with plumes reaching up to 250 meters or 820 feet high. 

This is the second time in a week that the Sorsogon volcano, one of the most active in the Philippines, erupted. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Philvolcs) in Bicol has been monitoring the volcano since the initial explosion happened on May 1.

Because of the two recent eruptions, Phivolcs plans to raise Bulusan's alert level status from 0 to 1, Phivolcs Director Renato Solidum told Rappler.

Alert Level 1 for Bulusan means ""low level unrest."" Though the two eruptions indicate hydrothermal disturbance, eruption is not immiment, according to the Phivolcs website.

Like the May 1 eruption, this second eruption was ""phreatic,"" resident volcanologist of Phivolcs-Bicol Ed Laguerta told Rappler. This means that the eruption was driven by steam and not by rising magma.

Phreatic eruptions often come without warning, skipping the usual alert levels issued by Phivolcs before an eruption.

This is because phreatic eruptions are caused by water contacting hot rock producing steam that then escapes the crater explosively. Such a phenomenon is difficult to pre-empt unlike other types of eruptions that are preceded by volcanic earthquakes or detectable rising magma.

Phreatic eruptions are apparently common in Mount Bulusan, said Laguerta.

The chance of Bulusan erupting again is ""more likely because it is in the nature of Bulusan to have sporadic phreatic activities,"" he said in a text message.

Bulusan is one of 23 active volcanoes in the Philippines. ",07/05/2015,https://www.rappler.com/nation/92399-mount-bulusan-sorsogon-erupts-again

The 12-year-old of the Bicol Region Athletic Association (BRAA) propelled himself to victory as he finished with a record of 5 meters and 61 centimeters after trailing from the first 3 jumps.

“Kinakabahan ako sa una, pero hindi ako nawalan ng pag-asa at naniwala ako sa aking sarili,"" Jason, an incoming high school freshman, said. (I was nervous at first, but I didn’t lose hope and I believed in myself.)

This is Jabol’s first Palarong Pambansa appearance.

Bicol Region’s star athlete, who also won gold in the Triple Jump event on Monday, said he did not expect to win another award. He dedicated the award to his school and his region.

Albay beach reveals ancient 'pillow lava',"ALBAY, Philippines – The seashore of Mirisbiris beach in Salvacion, Santo Domingo town, holds an ancient geologic formation: the beach is home to ancient pillow lavas, formed millions of years ago.

The formation was discovered by world-renowned geologist Christopher Newhall, after he and his Filipina wife Glenda acquired land in the village.

Newhall said that the pillow lavas were most probably generated through submarine volcano eruption or plate tectonic movement, most probably during the Cretaceous period – some 65 to 100 million years ago, when dinosaurs were still ruling the planet.

“We really don’t know the source of these pillow lavas, if this is [from] beneath the sea, but one thing is for sure: this was shaped during the Cretaceous period or during the Jurassic age,"" he said.

Pillow lavas are rock formations of volcanic origin, called such due to its similarity to piles of pillows. The volcanic action takes place under the sea: when a submarine volcano erupts, molten lava is ejected, and the lava rapidly solidifies on the outside due to contact with cold water.

The still-molten lava underneath then ruptures the surface, forming another layer of solidified lava. This process takes place numerous times, and the result looks like a mass of pillows on top of each other.

The pillow lava in Barangay Salvacion probably came from the uplifting of the sea floor due to collision of undersea plates, or from a possible ancient submarine volcano within the Albay Gulf area, Newhall explained.

""The people of this town are unaware of the existence of ancient history that shaped this town,"" he said.

From the USGS to Albay

The discovery of the pillow lavas is just a continuation of Newhall's decades-long work as a geologist, who moved to the Philippines permanently after decades of working with the US Geological Survey and then at the Earth Observatory of Singapore.

Newhall first set foot in the country as a Peace Corps volunteer in 1970, teaching geology at Aquinas University in Legazpi City, before working on the USGS’s Volcano Hazards Team in Seattle as volcanologist in 1980.

He has undergraduate and graduate geology degrees from the University of California, and completed his doctorate at Dartmouth College in 1980. He was also an affiliate professor of earth science at the University of Washington for 17 years.

He has also been helping Philippine government scientists, working with the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) for years, and helping local experts study abroad to specialize on volcanology.

He has also worked closely with legendary Filipino geologist Raymundo Punongbayan. He is also credited for devising the volcanic explosivity index (VEI) – the measure by which eruptions are compared.

After years of working with the world's top geologists, Newhall then opted to retire in Sto Domingo town to work with Albayanos. Now, he is developing a Web-linked worldwide network of volcano observatories which he believes is greatly needed to improve the ability to predict the behavior of these ticking tectonic time bombs.

Now, he and his wife Glenda are dedicated their lives to promote and preserve the value of nature, through the Mirisbiris Garden and Nature Center.

They built the center 3 years ago primarily as a private sanctuary, but they opened it to the public to to promote ecotourism and agritourism. It has a mini farm, where they have medicinal kitchen herbs, organic vegetables, and fruits. The place also serves as a venue for special events.

The center also has a mini-forest, with native species of trees such as yakal, sambulawan, katmon, mapilig, and hamurawon (molave). It also has a pebbly beach with a coral reef offshore. The reef, while partly damaged by silt, is still in reasonably good health.

“Glen and I were volunteers together for 40 years, and we decided to open Mirisbiris to the public to support scholarships for students from Salvacion and elsewhere. We’re been doing this already and are proud to have helped the students. But we can’t afford to do this alone. Former scholars are already helping new scholars and income from tourists will help greatly,” the world-renowned US geologist said.

Mount Bulusan in Sorsogon explodes,"ALBAY, Philippines – Mount Bulusan in the neighboring province of Sorsogon exploded on Friday morning, May 1, spewing steam and ash for 5 minutes, seismic records showed.

Ed Laguerta, resident volcanologist of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) in the Bicol region, said the ash explosion, which started at 8:09 am, drifted toward the villages of Puting Sapa and Sangayon in Juban town, and in the villages of Cogon, Gulang-Gulang, and Tinampo in Irosin town.

Bulusan is one of the most active volcanoes in the Philippines. It last erupted in 2011.

“This is just a minor explosion, which coincided with Labor Day celebration. We’re closely monitoring the activity if it will escalate in the coming days,” Laguerta said.

The explosion was initially not visible from a distance given the thick rain clouds that covered the summit. At around 10:30 am, when the skies cleared up, strong to moderate, dirty white steam was observed. It reached 200 meters high and drifted west-northwest coming from the northwest vent of the volcano.

The Bulusan seismic networ detected 5 volcanic earthquakes the past week. After the steam and ash explosion on Friday, the network recorded approximately 40 volcanic earthquakes.

While Phivolcs have yet to raise alert over Bulusan Volcano, local government units and the public are reminded that entry to the 4-kilometer radius Permanent Danger Zone (PDZ) is strictly prohibited due to the possibility of sudden and hazardous steam-driven or phreatic eruptions.

Phivolcs officials also warned people living within valleys and along rivers and stream channels should be vigilant against sediment-laden stream flows and lahars in the event of heavy and prolonged rainfall.

Civil aviation authorities have been told to advise pilots to avoid flying close to the volcano’s summit, as any sudden phreatic eruption could eject materials that are hazardous to aircraft. ",01/05/2015,https://www.rappler.com/nation/91804-mount-bulusan-sorsogon-explosion
DILG releases P133M for Bicol projects,"MANILA, Philippines – Over P133.5 million will be given to local government units (LGUs) in the Bicol region, Interior Secretary Manuel Roxas II said when he visited Legazpi City.

In a statement released Thursday, April 30, the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) said the following were distributed:

11 checks worth P26 million to 9 Albay LGUs
3 checks worth more than P9.4 million to 2 Camarines Norte LGUs
22 checks worth almost P61 million to 16 Camarines Sur LGUs
5 checks worth almost P3 million to 3 Catanduanes LGUs
10 checks worth more than P27 million to 9 Masbate LGUs
7 checks worth almost P7 million to 6 Sorsogon LGUs
The funding will be used to finance local projects under the government’s “bottom-up budgeting” (BUB) process, the department added.

Roxas himself handed over checks to 9 Albay LGUs during a gathering of members of the Koalisyon ng Mamamayan Para sa Reporma (KOMPRe), a group that “[supports] leaders with unquestioned integrity and competence because reforms can only be sustained by upstanding appointed and elected public servants.”

The interior secretary said the BUB process, wherein locals pick priority projects from a set “menu,” is a “clear example” of the administation’s “Daang Matuwid (Straight Path).”

“Hindi politiko, hindi mga opisyal ng gobyerno ang nagsabi nito. Kayo ang nagsabi nito. Ito ang Daang Matuwid na tinatahak natin,” said Roxas. (Politicians or government officials did not have a say in this. You picked these projects. This is the straight path that we’re treading.)

While Roxas has touted the benefits of the BUB program, his critics see it as a means for the Liberal Party stalwart to prepare for a possible 2016 presidential bid.

During the 2015 budget deliberations for the DILG, senators criticized what they saw as a “lopsided” budget. Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago said the proposed national budget for the pre-election favors the DILG since funds are allocated to it for programs that are outside its mandate.

Senator Francis Escudero insisted the DILG’s budget would do nothing to help a possible 2016 campaign.

While Liberal Party members and allies have said Roxas will be the party’s standard bearer in 2016, Roxas himself has remained coy about his plans.",30/04/2015,https://www.rappler.com/nation/91691-roxas-bicol-dilg-budget
"GMA-7 'not in the red,' layoffs a 'callous move' – NUJP","MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – Broadcasting giant GMA-7's dismissal of its staff in regional stations despite being financially robust is callous, heartless, and appalling, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP) said in a statement on Monday, April 27.

NUJP regarded the network's claim of ""strategic streamlining"" to justify the layoffs as a ""play on words"" that ""belies the grim reality that almost all employees in regional news desks of the network will lose their jobs.""

Questioning the justification that GMA-7 used, NUJP argued that the network ""is not on the brink of bankruptcy with no recourse but to let go of its employees to stay afloat.""

Under the Constitution, workers are guaranteed security of tenure or the right against termination without just cause and due process.

""GMA-7 is not in the red. It is not bleeding,"" NUJP explained, citing the network giant's reported ""net income of P1.01 billion in 2014 and at least a billion pesos yearly in 2012 and 2013.""

It said the network's management – ""in one swoop"" and ""without sufficient warning"" on April 23 and 24 – ""put in peril the future of the families of hundreds of its employees and talents, many of whom have spent many years of their lives dedicated to the company and the public that they serve.""

Mike Tolang, a veteran cameraman in Cagayan de Oro, said employees like him were left in the dark with no idea of what hit them and what awaits them. The only instruction was that they are not to report to the news desk until Wednesday, April 29, he added.

""Clearly, hundreds of jobs and lives have been put in the altar of sacrifice for more profits for its owners and investors at the expense of loyal and dedicated employees and talents,"" NUJP alleged.

""Based on a compensation filing made by the network, its top 5 executives received a total of P141.72 million"" in 2014, NUJP said.

""We stand with our colleagues who lost their jobs. What happened to them can happen to any media worker in the country who, despite our noble profession, many continue to be treated as dispensable pawns,"" it added.

The group also challenged businessman Ramon Ang, who recently acquired a 30% stake in the network, if he really wants ""to team up with a company that does not think twice of letting its people go for the sake of revenues alone.""

NUJP disseminated its statement on social media and used the heart-shaped rendering found in the GMA-7 logo, but in black. A version of this was seen on Monday evening as the cover photo in GMA-7 Davao local morning show Una Ka Bai's Facebook page.

The said union of journalists boasts of some 1,500 members worldwide.

Sought for comment, GMA-7 said it understood NUJP's stance in favor of the affected journalists but found unfortunate the group's disregard of the network's ""substantial losses from its regional operations and from its local programs.""

Only ""after many years"" of such losses did it discontinue some of the local programs, its statement read.

Ang, the network maintained, ""had absolutely nothing to do with the decision.""

Reports from various provinces

In defense of the retrenchments, the network previously said it ""is in the process of undertaking a strategic streamlining of programs and manpower in its provincial stations to ensure business competitiveness.""

The reduction in manpower ""targets more efficient operations,"" it added in a statement. ""Severance packages are offered by GMA to all affected personnel.""

On Friday, April 24, a representative from GMA-7 in Manila came to Bacolod to inform the regional office's staff that their last day of work was also on that day. At least 20 employees were laid off.

The only local show, Isyu Subong Negrense, also went off air.

The GMA Bacolod office will still operate as a relay of the local channel, but there will be no employees, only engineers, working.

GMA-7 Cagayan de Oro, on the other hand, had its last local broadcast last Friday. Staff members said they will have a final meeting on Wednesday.

There are at least 40 employees in GMA-7 Northern Mindanao.

In the cities of Legazpi and Naga in Bicol, reports have surfaced some time last February about the closing down of the network's offices there.

In Cebu, the retrenched employees have turned to social media, such as social networking site Facebook, to express their dismay. Journalists in Cebu were urged to turn their profile pictures to plain black.

Sara Duterte, former Davao City mayor and host of GMA-7 Davao's local morning show Una Ka Bai, posted on her Instagram account a photo of her alarm clock in her phone and said: ""Goodbye alarm.

Typhoon Chedeng enters PH area of responsibility,"MANILA, Philippines – Typhoon Maysak has entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) late Wednesday evening, April 1, and has been given the local codename Chedeng.

As of 11 pm Wednesday, Chedeng was located 1,015 km east northeast of Guiuan, Eastern Samar, or 1,040 km east of Borongan, Eastern Samar, with maximum sustained winds of 180 km/h near the center and gusts of up to 215 km/h, state weather bureau PAGASA said in its first severe weather bulletin for the system.

Chedeng, however, is still too far to affect any part of the country.

  
The system is estimated to bring heavy to at times intense rainfall within its 150-200 km radius, the bureau said.

Chedeng/Maysak is still considered as a Super Typhoon by the US Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Center. Meanwhile, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) labels Chedeng as a ""very strong"" typhoon.

Chedeng is forecast to move west northwest at 19 km/h, and is seen to be 850 km east of Legazpi City by Thursday evening, April 2.

PAGASA forecast tracks show the typhoon moving in the general direction of the Cagayan Valley area.

The bureau said it is ready to raise Public Storm Warning Signal number 1 in Bicol and Samar provinces in the next 18 hours.

  
Landfall is predicted to occur between late Saturday, April 4, and early Sunday, April 5, in the vicinity of Aurora, Quezon, or Isabela provinces.

""The public is alerted against possible flashfloods over low-lying areas and landslides along mountain slopes particularly over Aurora-Quezon area,"" the bureau said.

In addition, ""storm surges and sea surface waves of up to 4 meters are possible over the eastern coast of Samar, Bicol,"" and the provinces of Aurora and Quezon.

The next bulletin will be issued at 11 am Thursday, the bureau said.",02/04/2015,https://www.rappler.com/nation/special-coverage/weather-alert/88695-20150401-chedeng-evening-update
"Bicol, Samar are front liners for Typhoon Maysak","MANILA, Philippines – Within 24 hours, Public Storm Warning Signal No 1 will be raised over Bicol and Samar region in preparation for Typhoon Maysak, state weather bureau PAGASA announced during a Wednesday, April 1, press briefing.

These regions are likely the first to be affected by the typhoon, which will be named ""Chedeng"" when it enters the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR).

Maysak was spotted 1,165 kilometers east of Guiuan, Eastern Samar at 4 pm on Wednesday, April 1.

It had maximum sustained winds of 190 kilometers/hour (km/h) with gusts of up to 230 km/h, showing the typhoon has weakened. But PAGASA Administrator Vicente Malano says to still take caution.

""It will still be a strong typhoon. There is no room for complacency,"" he said.

 

Even if the typhoon weakens, it is still likely to have wind speeds of 150 to 170 km/h at the time of landfall.

It is expected to enter the PAR either late Wednesday, April 1, or early Thursday morning, April 2. PAGASA and other foreign weather forecasting agencies predict roughly the same track for the storm.

Different forecast models show it will make landfall either late Saturday, April 4, or early Sunday, April 5, in 3 possible areas: Aurora, Quezon, and Isabela.

Maysak is still expected to weaken as it approaches Philippine landmass. This is because ocean temperatures around the archipelago are not very high, depriving Maysak of a source of energy to get stronger.

High ocean temperatures are typically what strengthens typhoons.

Safe to travel?

Those traveling during the Holy Week may have to adjust their plans given Maysak's approach.

Malano said it may still be safe to travel by land up to Friday morning, April 3. But by Friday evening, strong winds and rain will already be felt, making it unwise.

Of particular danger is travel by land through mountainous areas, said Malano. Winds and rain are likely to cause landslides which could hit unwary vehicles or clog up roads resulting in traffic or bottlenecks.

The travel of boats, meanwhile, will be suspended as soon as Public Storm Warning Signal No. 1 is raised in areas where the boats will pass.

As for air travel, advisories will come from the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP), which is already coordinating with PAGASA.

Though Maysak has weakened, it may still generate storm surges along coastal areas that could go up to 3 meters (10 feet) high.

Baler in Aurora, a popular surfing spot, is particularly susceptible.

""There is a history of storm surges occurring in Baler Bay. In 1981, during a storm with 200 km/h winds, storm surges reached 4 to 5 meters,"" he said.

Maysak is expected to leave the PAR on Tuesday, April 7, or Wednesday, April 8.

Still fair weather on Thursday

Maysak is still too far to be affecting the archipelago. On Thursday, April 2, only cloudy skies are expected in Cagayan Valley, Cordillera, and Ilocos.

Metro Manila and the rest of the country may experience only isolated rainshowers or thunderstorms.

Light to moderate winds will prevail in all regions resulting in slight to moderate seas. ",01/04/2015,https://www.rappler.com/nation/special-coverage/weather-alert/88667-typhoon-maysak-update

Individuals from different fields such as the tourism industry, media, and even local government units were awarded last February 12.

Governor Joey Salceda was awarded under the Local Chief Executive category for his internationally recognized efforts in the growth of Albay's tourism.

Despite being battered by numerous typhoons annually, Salceda was able to maximize the potential of the natural resources and landscape of his province using a comprehensive tourism work plan, including the Albay-Masbate-Sorsogon (ALMASOR) Tourism Alliance.

A climate justice and sustainable development advocate himself, Governor Salceda is staunch supporter of investing in nature and culture. (READ: No more self-pity: Salceda suggests 5 steps to rebuilding)

“It is about shifting to investment-based tourism. Encouraging people to invest in developing natural landscapes and local cultures,” he said. “Ang daming magagawa eh. Talagang ginamit ko ang lahat ng opportunity na binigay ng DOT para ma-advertise yung Albay.”

(A lot can be done. I used all the opportunities the DOT offered me to advertise Albay.)

According to him, the private sector can also play a more active role in developing sustainable tourism establishments.

Biggest driving factors

The youth is perhaps one of the biggest driving factors of the Philippine tourism industry today. Aside from being travellers, they now take on the roles of innovative social entrepreneurs, operators and knowledgeable guides.

Gerry Bie “Andoy” Dalimag grew up helping the local tourism industry of Cagayan. He serves as an inspiration for the youth and the passion that goes with helping yourself and your country.

Despite his modest upbringing, Dalimag continues to serve as a volunteer guide around the famous Callao Caves simply working on tips as a means for allowance as he pursues a Tourism degree in college.

Famous for his show on GMA 7 “Biyahe ni Drew,” TV Host Drew Arellano was recognized for his exhilarating adventures around the Philippines.

Known for his wacky yet personable demeanor, he has grown a fanbase that awaits his weekly experiences that highlight various hotspots around the country, thus fuelling a tourism spirit for the country.

Meanwhile, for those who traverse multiple travel blogs to learn about their next Philippine adventure, Our Awesome Planet is a familiar destination blog on their browsers if not already bookmarked.

Food and travel blogger Anton Diaz was awarded for his pioneering efforts in Philippine tourism blogging.

After almost a decade of blogging about his travels around the country, he has earned the recognition as the top independent lifestyle blog that celebrates the best travel destinations in the Philippines and around the world.

Passion for conservation

Evident among all the awardees is a sense of passion for their efforts in promoting Philippine tourism and it could not have been better said by Bobby Adrao.

Fuelled by a determination to maintain the pristine Donsol, Sorsogon marine environment, Adrao’s work with the world-renowned Donsol Whale Sharks has earned him a spot on the list of Tourism Stars.

His unwavering dedication to preserve these natural wonders resulted to a heightened awareness among communities regarding the importance of the marine inhabitants.

“Kailangan mo lang tutukan ang iyong trabaho at maging matiyaga sa ginagawa mo,” he emphasized. “Kailangan talagang bigyang halaga ang dagat, ang kayamanan ng kalikasan at mga taong nag-proprotekta nito katulad ng mga dive masters at komunidad.”

(You just need to really focus on your work and be determined in everything you do. It is necessary to value the ocean, natural resources and the people who protect them like dive masters and communities.)

With Tourism Star Awards, DOT hopes to strengthen the efforts of individuals and institutions that pave way for a more tourism-friendly country. It seeks to inspire other people to further grow their travelling spirit.",19/02/2015,https://www.rappler.com/bulletin-board/84062-department-tourism-stars
Why family of slain SAF from Bicol didn't wait for Aquino,"CATANDUANES, Philippines – There were 42 bodies that arrived at the Villamor Air Base on Thursday, January 29, where they were honored with a welcome ceremony that President Benigno Aquino III skipped.

By evening, only 41 caskets bearing members of the Philippine National Police Special Action Force (PNP SAF) who died in Maguindanao were brought to Camp Bagong Diwa in Taguig City.

The remains of Police Senior Inspector Max Jim Tria, 27, did not – would not – wait for the scheduled tribute of President Benigno Aquino III to the fallen troopers in Camp Bagong Diwa and was flown straight to his home province, Catanduanes.

Police Senior Inspector Guillermo Tria, the fallen officer's father, told local media in Catanduanes that this was an act of protest.

He wanted the President to condemn the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, whose elements were responsible for the death of the SAF troopers, and to rethink the proposed Bangsamoro law that would initially put the MILF at the helm of an expanded autonomous region in Mindanao.

In his address to the nation on January 28, the President mourned the ill fate of the young officers but stressed the importance of continuing the peace process despite the incident. (READ: Aquino defends SAF operation in Maguindanao)

The Trias brought home Max Jim's body early morning Friday, January 30, to Virac, Catanduanes, where relatives, 20 police academy batchmates assigned in the Bicol region, and local officials paid tribute to him – just before a necrological service for the 41 other fallen SAF members in Manila.

The family is from Cabihian village in Virac. The father of the slain trooper is officer-in-charge of the Provincial Internal Affairs Service at PNP provincial command in Catanduanes.

Albay Governor Joey Salceda echoed the sentiments of Tria's family. “Many may disagree with me, but the issue here is justice for victims of MILF brutality and betrayal. The constituency for peace has been decimated by the violence and can only be restored by justice....The betrayal is despicable. Our dignity violated and our trust destroyed. Our sorrow is indescribable.”

Batchmates shave head in mourning

The fallen hero was met by his family, his 20 mistahs currently assigned in the Bicol region, government officials in Catanduanes led by Governor Cely Wong, PNP provincial officials led by Senior Superintendent Adel Castillo, and relatives, friends and fellow Catandunganons.

Tria’s weeping batchmates from the Philippine National Police Academy (PNPA) were led by Police Senior Inspector Jan King Calipay (now chief of police of Polangui town in Albay) who carried his casket.

Three members of PNPA Kaisang-Bisig Class 2009 died in the Maguindanao clash, which the government has called a ""misencounter"" – a label widely protested by the police organization. Aside from Max Jim, Police Senior Inspector Gednat Tabdi, and Police Senior Inspector Garry Erana, the class baron, also perished in the clash.

The 20 Kaisang-Bisig class members assigned across the Bicol region shaved their heads to mourn the death of their batchmates.

“We’re grieving for our mistahs and the rest of the troopers who perished in the carnage. Our snappiest salute to our fallen brothers and heroes of Maguindanao carnage, but we’re also seeking justice,” Calipay said.

'They expect empathy from the President'

Chief Superintendent Victor Deona, PNP Bicol regional director, also expressed sorrow over the killing of the SAF men, but called on his men not to be swayed by their emotions.

“My heart bleeds for the SAF troopers. I had been in the operation unit for so long. I personally saw the same incident with my own eyes and I know how it grieves their loved ones,” Deona said.

“This might be very painful to us, but we need to accept the fact. Emotions should not rule. Emotions must be contained and we must be guided by reasons,” he added.

Salceda said: “Our people are deeply thankful to them as we, especially our youth, take inspiration from the moral courage they have demonstrated when they enforced the rule of law and secure social justice for our nation. Unmistakably, they prove that there is hope for the Philippines as a nation-state.”

The governor also called out the President on what was perceived as his lack of emphathy for the slain cops and their families.

“Some people around the President should understand that Filipinos love PNoy so much that they expect so much more in return. The medals, the burial expenses, the scholarships and all the other over-offered assistance lay like frills and furbelows in the calculus of mutual solicitude in period of massive grief,” Salceda said.

“They actually expect something simpler...they expect he would be more capable of empathy, those undefinable body of words and movements that speak of sincerity flowing with no effort from the heart,” the governor added.

The provincial government of Albay is providing a P10,000 assistance for the families of the 44 slain troopers.

Administration allies have defended the President from criticism about his supposed lack of empathy for the slain officers and their families, citing his move to spend over 12 hours with the latter and the wounded SAF troopers in Camp Bagong Diwa on January 30.

Rare megamouth shark washes ashore in Albay,"MANILA, Philippines – A megamouth shark washed ashore in Albay on Wednesday, January 28, a rare sighting of the usually deep ocean-dwelling animal.

The shark, with the scientific name Megachasma pelagios, washed ashore in Barangay Marigondon, Pio Duran, Albay, the Marine Wildlife Watch of the Philippines posted on its page on Facebook.

This is only the 60th confirmed sighting of the shark, said Christopher Bird of the research blog Shark Devocean.

The shark measured 15 feet long, and was identified with the help of officials from the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources' Regional Emergency Stranding Response Team.

No cause of death has been determined yet, the BFAR said.

Megamouth sharks are characterized by their wide, gaping mouths with rubbery lips, used to filter plankton and jellyfish on which they subsist on.

Most specimens have been found in Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines, although sightings have been reported in places such as California, Hawaii, and Senegal.

The dead shark is currently stored in ice by the BFAR regional office as it awaits further examination by veterinarians.

The BFAR is now planning to preserve the specimen – the third in the Philippines, if ever, the Philippine Daily Inquirer reported",29/01/2015,https://www.rappler.com/science-nature/environment/82314-rare-megamouth-shark-washes-ashore-albay
