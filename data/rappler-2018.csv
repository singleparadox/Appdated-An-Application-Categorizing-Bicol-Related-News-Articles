Photo by Mavic Conde/Rappler MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The death toll from Tropical Depression Usman climbed to 68 with the number of fatalities expected to increase higher, said the Office of Civil Defense Bicol Region Monday, December 31.Fifty-seven people died in the Bicol region, while 11 were killed in Samar, mostly due to landslides and drownings, the OCD officials said.""I am afraid this (death toll) will still go up because there are a lot of areas we still have to clear,"" said Claudio Yucot, Bicol civil defense director.Earlier, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC), said its record Sunday night, December 20, had 61 people dead, 18 people recorded missing and 12 others from Mimaropa, Bicol Region, and Eastern Visayas. They were also still validating reports Monday.Landslides had occurred in Albay on Saturday, December 29 and Friday, December 28, which left at least 12 dead as of Sunday.Apart from this, landslides were also reported in Nato town, Camarines Sur. Ten bodies were recovered in the area.Yucot said many people failed to take necessary precautions because Usman was not strong enough to be rated as a typhoon by Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA)..""People were overconfident because they were on (Christmas) vacation mode and there was no tropical cyclone warning,"" Yucot told AFP.Although Usman has been downgraded into a low pressure and has since moved westward away from the country, many affected areas were still experiencing seasonal rains, hampering rescue and recovery efforts, he added.Bicol OCD counted 17 people still missing and more than 40,000 were displaced nationwide. In an updated report from the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) Disaster Response and Management Bureau (DRMB), 3,488 families or 13,469 persons were moved to 112 evacuation centers. The residents were from Calabarzon, Mimaropa, Bicol, and Eastern Visayas.Meanwhile, the DSWD report also said 189 families or 939 individuals decided to stay with relatives and friends but were still being served by the agency.So far, about P395,144 worth of aid has been provided by the DSWD to local government units. Emergency telecommunication equipment is also on standby if needed, the DSWD said.According to data from the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), the low pressure area which used to be Tropical Depression Usman dumped large volumes of rainfall in parts of Luzon and the Visayas in just two days. (READ: How much rain did Tropical Depression Usman bring?)Daet, Camarines Norte; Legazpi City, Albay; and Catarman, Northern Samar, had the most rain from Friday, December 28, to Saturday, December 29.Heavy rains prompted local officials to declare a state of calamity in Camarines Sur, Albay, and Sorsogon.Usman left the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) on Sunday, but the northeast monsoon or amihan is still affecting Luzon. – with reports from Sofia Tomacruz, Agence France Presse/Rappler.com",31/12/2018,http://www.rappler.com/nation/220005-tropical-depression-usman-death-toll-december-31-2018

In this file photo posted on his Facebook account a day before he was shot on December 22,2018, Rep. Rodel Batocabe is seen with Daraga residents. Batocabe led meetings of the party-list coalition on the matter, but he told Rappler in early December that they have failed to come up with a unified stand. While most lawmakers are allied with the majority bloc, some are also part of the opposition groups in the House. Still, Batocabe echoed De Vera’s contention on the latter’s removal as lawmaker – that only the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal, not the plenary, has jurisdiction to remove a sitting member of the chamber.  “Such jurisdiction is exclusive and includes the determination of the qualifications of the nominee to seat in Congress. Thus, it is my position that a party-list nominee who took his oath and assumed office in the HOR is protected by the Constitution and by the institution itself. As such, he cannot just be summarily removed by a mere letter claiming that he is no longer a member of his party-list,” said the late congressman. Transpo issuesBatocabe had been in the headlines in his last months in the House, mostly for his stance on transportation issues. He wanted the government to incentivize local manufacturers to build new jeepneys under the public utility vehicle modernization program. In July 2017, Batocabe had also demanded accountability from transport network companies and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board in cases of accidents on the road. At the time, Batocabe was grieving the death of his nephew, who died after the latter’s Uber vehicle crashed in Singapore. Batocabe had his share of controversies, too.The late congressman drew flak last year for filing bill that would impose a 30% tax on cosmetic products. But he said he will stop pushing for the passage of the measure so he won’t get in the way of Filipinos’ “happiness.”Batocabe, however, took pride in being an advocate for education, especially in his home region, Bicol.“The easiest, cheapest and honorable way to fight poverty and move up the socio-economic ladder is through education. Hence, making quality education  accessible to all, especially the masses, should not only be an advocacy of AKO BICOL but must be its continuous and  firm commitment so long as there are still people hoping and dreaming to escape from the clutches of poverty,” said Batocabe. – with reports from Camille Elemia/Rappler.com",22/12/2018,http://www.rappler.com/nation/219476-rodel-batocabe-profile

We are clueless as of the moment on the motive of the killing and the identities of the suspects,” Barcia-Gonzales said.Diaz succumbed to 6 gunshot wounds.6 woundedAt least six others were wounded in the attack, Daraga police chief Superintendent Bento Dipad said.Barangay Burgos, where they were shot, is a far-flung village that is already near Sorsogon province.Lawmakers immediately condemned the murders.The incident is the first known killing of an elected official in Daraga, the PNP said.At least 7 mayors and 12 mayors have been slain under Duterte's watch, Rappler's tally showed. Hours before Batocabe was killed, the former mayor of a Bukidnon town was also murdered.Batocabe was the vice chairperson of the House committees on dangerous drugs, good government and public accountability, and natural resources.He is the president of the partylist coalition in the House of Representatives. He used to be part of the majority bloc under former Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez but is now a member of the minority under House Minority Leader Danilo Suarez. Albay Representative Edcel Lagman expressed outrage over Batocabe’s killing. “His killers and their mastermind must be relentlessly pursued, apprehended, and brought to justice without delay,” Lagman said in a statement. He added: “Politics must not be stained by the blood of politicians and partisans. It must be confined to the confrontation of ideas and programs in the tranquil fora of mutual respect and civility.” – with reports from Mara Cepeda and Rhaydz Barcia/Rappler.com",22/12/2018,http://www.rappler.com/nation/219472-rodel-batocabe-killed-albay-december-2018

File photo by Bobby Lagsa/Rappler TACLOBAN, Philippines – The top Philippine Army officer in Eastern Visayas said the additional deployment of troops to the 3 provinces of Samar Island would be key to driving out communist rebels and private armed groups (PAGs).President Rodrigo Duterte had ordered that more soldiers and police be sent to the provinces of Samar, Negros Oriental, and Negros Occidental, as well as the region of Bicol, to ""suppress lawless violence and acts of terror.""

Vice President Leni Robredo says Malacañang should justify its use of the term 'lawless violence,' as many people worry about creeping martial law     ON DUTERTE'S ORDER. Vice President Leni Robredo says government should also answer questions on why there has been more activity among communist insurgents in the last two years. Photo by Office of the Vice President  MANILA, Philippines – Vice President Leni Robredo on Sunday, November 25, questioned President Rodrigo Duterte's new memorandum order (MO) against lawless violence, even as she did not object to increasing troops in Bicol, Samar, and Negros Island. Robredo said Malacañang should justify its use of the term ""lawless violence,"" as many worried about creeping martial law across the country. ""Wala tayong objection sa pag-augment. Very welcome iyon na balita (We have no objections about augmenting them. That's very welcome news),"" Robredo said on her Sunday radio show Biserbisyong Leni.But Robredo also said, ""Natatakot iyong mga tao na baka parang platform ito para magdeklara ng martial law na palagay ng lahat, kahit pa may ambush dito, hindi naman kailangan… Mas dapat sagutin bakit ba in the last two years, tumindi na naman iyong insurgency."" (This is worrisome for the public because it can be used as grounds to declare martial law, which, although ambushes happen here, is not needed... What needs to be answered is why insurgency has intensified over the last two years.)Presidential Spokesman Salvador Panelo said on Friday, November 23, that news reports of New People's Army attacks were among those Duterte considered in issuing MO 32.MO 32 orders the Department of National Defense and the Department of the Interior and Local Government to ""coordinate the immediate deployment of additional forces of the AFP (Armed Forces of the Philippines) and PNP (Philippine National Police) to suppress lawless violence and acts of terror"" in those areas.Rising insurgencyRobredo then noted that violent activities by insurgents have been commonplace since the administration of former president Corazon Aquino and the presidencies afterwards.She said these lessened during the administration of former president Benigno Aquino III.Robredo, though, said with an increase in these incidents, it was necessary for government to look into why these were happening.Robredo's statement was echoed by Liberal Party (LP) senatorial bet Chel Diokno, who said that supposed instances of ""lawless violence"" needed to be validated before any declaration of a state of emergency is issued.""'Pag hindi sinusunod ang proseso, nagbibigay-daan ito sa pang-aabuso. Katarungan at hindi pang-aabuso ang ating hinahangad,"" Diokno said in a statement Sunday. (If this process is not followed, it ill give way to abuse. We are after justice, not abuse.)Meanwhile, LP Senate bet Erin Tañada said MO 32 was a ""fear-mongering"" tactic of the Duterte administration, which took attention away from economic problems such as the increasing prices of goods and high inflation.""The people of Samar, Bicol, and Negros will suffer even more with this increased militarization… They want the government's attention and resources to be directed at the real problem – which is inflation and sky-rocketing prices – not at imagined ones,"" he said. – Rappler.com",25/11/2018,http://www.rappler.com/nation/217502-robredo-questions-duterte-order-lawless-violence

Duterte and the military have alleged that the NPA is behind the massacre of 9 sugarcane farmers in Sagay City, Negros Occidental last October 20.Two days before the Sagay incident, 3 police escorts and a Food and Drug Administration official were killed in a NPA ambush in Lupi, Camarines Sur in the Bicol region.On October 30, a police officer was wounded in a suspected NPA attack in Guihulngan, Negros Oriental. In a statement later on Friday, Presidential Spokesman Salvador Panelo confirmed that the incidents were among those Duterte considered in issuing MO 32.

Spooky school stories: Bicol University edition,"Read more
Creatures of myth and horror stories passed down from one generation of BUeños to another     LEGAZPI CITY, Philippines – Built in 1969, Bicol University has an almost paradoxical charm: it is in the capital city but has a backdrop of trees and mountains.Consistent with this mixed urban-rural appeal, this tranquil haven for the scholars of Albay also has its fair share of spine-chilling stories of the paranormal, from creatures of myth to urban legends, passed down from one generation of BUeños to another.CenTree’s kapreOld school they may be, but classic mythological creatures like the kapre exist in BU’s trove of paranormal stories.These tree giants are said to dwell in balete trees, but BU’s resident kapre has supposedly found a different abode: a century-old acacia tree called by BUeños as the Centree, located in the Commencement Grounds near the university’s Four Pillars. According to stories, the Centree’s kapre is 12 feet tall, hairy, and with heavy dilated eyes. Witnesses claimed they saw it smoking a tobacco pipe while sitting on the tree’s branches. It didn’t end well for the kapre however, as its home was unfortunately uprooted during Typhoon Glenda in 2014. Nobody knows whatever happened to the big guy, but some still claim that it has never abandoned the spot where the Centree once stood, and that its shadow can be seen near the Four Pillars at night.Ghost of CS Building 2A female ghost, about 18 to 20 years old, is said to be roaming around Building 2 of the College of Science. According to stories, there are times when she can be seen passing by the washroom’s mirror, sitting in classes, or just hanging out at the computer laboratory.An encounter between this lady ghost and a student supposedly happened recently. An IT freshman was busy programming in a make-up class on the opening day of BU Week when her computer suddenly shut down, even though there was no power interruption that day. Her professor saw her and told her to just continue working on her task, and offered his computer.After class, her professor told her why he let her use his computer. He said that earlier, he saw a woman standing beside her. “Yung babaeng nakatayo sa likod mo, pinatay ‘yung computer mo (The woman behind you turned off your computer),” he said.College of NursingJust recently, a supposed alumni of the College of Nursing shared a creepy experience on Facebook using the pseudonym Nightingale’s Diadem. She said she was a freshman when the incident happened, and had classes in the building until 8 pm. One night, as they were about to go home, she asked her friends to wait for her in the lobby as she had to go to the toilet.As she washed her hands, the cubicle doors suddenly swung open. The student just shrugged it off and headed to the lobby to rejoin her friends. She then saw her friend “J” in front of the Hospital/RLE Room talking to herself. Upon seeing her, J, who looked pale and mortified, asked her to go to the Cathedral of San Gregorio Magno.After praying, J claimed to have seen a girl who looked and dressed exactly like her, but without a philtrum. This doppelganger supposedly talked to J in Spanish, saying: “I like her. Your friend in the comfort room, she’s beautiful.”The same anonymous alumni also claimed an encounter with the ghost of a Spanish insular (full-blooded Spaniard born in colonies) and a young lady asking for help in the same building.MP BuildingThe multi-purpose building is the setting of a diverse collection of horror stories.One story is about a ghastly baboy ramo (wild boar) that supposedly caused some students to trip and fall in the 4th floor of the building. Some claim they heard this boar wail in the hallway. Also dwelling on the 4th floor of the MP building is the so-called “Pajama Girl,” the ghost of a small girl who is said to be looking for someone to play with. Sometimes, she is seen carrying a ball.On the 3rd floor of the building meanwhile, student journalists are often warned not to use the ladies' toilet when doing overnight press work. According to some, this toilet is haunted by a female ghost who was a rape victim. Some claim hearing cries and heavy breathing from inside the toilet, and some claim even seeing her reflection on the mirror. Meanwhile, on the 2nd floor, a female ghost with long and straight dark hair is said to roam along the hallway dressed in white.Perhaps the most notorious of all haunted rooms in the MP is Room 307.According to some students, the ghosts of a young girl and young boy are often seen playing in the room. By sitting inside Room 307, students claim to be able to hear giggles and small footsteps padding around the classroom. On rare occasions, chairs were seen moving by themselves. There are variations to this story: some say these kids' faces are smeared with blood, while some say their eyes are red. Some also say that the presence of these kids can also be felt in Room 312 or 313.Are you a BUeño with a spooky story to share?

Photo by Earl Vincent Cañaveral MANILA, Philippines – Bicol Central Academy (BCA) administrator Alexander James Jaucian will pay for the students' belongings, which were destroyed or damaged when he supposedly ordered their bags burned after they failed to follow a no-bag policy for a school event.Department of Education (DepEd) Secretary Leonor Briones gave students and their families this assurance at a press conference on Thursday, August 30.“At the level of the board of the school, they have to do something about that administrator kasi tao nila 'yun (because he is their their responsibility)….

About P19,615 in cash will be paid back to students who had money inside their burned bags.This does not include the cost of damaged belongings, such as laptops, clothing, pocket wifi, cellular phones, and other school materials, which Jaucian will also cover. “The administrator has to be held responsible. We were told that it is just that the method of the administrator in dealing with problems with students is unorthodox. Well, sabi ko (I said), in so far as procedures and processes are concerned, DepEd is very orthodox,” Briones said.The BCA board of trustees likewise suspended Jaucian for 90 days, starting August 20, without pay.A letter from Jaucian noted that he would also apologize to students and voluntarily submit himself to an anger management program.DepEd Bicol Director Gilbert Sadsad earlier told Rappler his office would ask the Department of Social Welfare and Development to file criminal charges against Jaucian for violation of the Child Protection Policy.Briones added: ""It should be an example to all other schools, whether private or public, that learners’ property has to be respected and, even more, learners have to be respected.

DepEd Bicol Director Gilbert Sadsad reads the sanctions against Bicol Central Academy school administrator Alexander James Jaucian who punished students by burning their bags. Screenshot from Rhaydz's Barcia's video   ALBAY, Philippines – The Department of Education (DepEd)  in Bicol said it will ask the Department of Social Welfare and Development to file criminal charges against Bicol Central Academy (BCA) school administrator Alexander James Jaucian for violation of the Child Protection Policy. Viral photos posted on social media showed Jaucian allegedly ordering that the bags of students be burned after they failed to comply with the ""no-bag"" policy for a school event.DepEd Bicol Director Gilbert Sadsad told Rappler that they will also ask the board of directors of BCA in Libmanan, Camarines Sur, to remove Jaucian from the school.""We will ask the board of directors of Bicol Central Academy to remove him (Alexander James Jaucian) from the school management. [We will also ask] the Department of Social Welfare Development to file criminal charges, and the Bureau of Fire Protection in Libmanan to investigate it for possible arson case,"" Sadsad said.He said Jaucian's action was completely unacceptable, and that it caused fear and trauma among the affected students in grade 11.Sadsad personally visited the BCA together with guidance counselors in Camarines Sur to conduct stress debriefing among the affected students. When asked about the condition of the students, Sadsad said some students he talked to and those interviewed by guidance counselors were angry and expressed hatred against Jaucian's action.Jaucian was not present when Sadsad visited the school, as he was in Manila to report and explain his action before the Bicol Central Academy's board of directors, but Jaucian promised to be present during the second day of the investigation on August 22.The school was also closed on Monday due to a holiday that was declared even before the incident occurred, but the school will hold a makeup class on Friday, August 24.AdmissionSadsad said that even before his visit, Jaucian already called him up to explain his side and narrate what really transpired on Friday, August 17.Sadsad recalled that Jaucian admitted that he ordered their utility man to gather the bags of the grade 11 students and set them on fire for not following the ""no-bag"" policy. Jaucian said senior high school (SHS) students were instructed on Friday not to bring backpacks, as they would be wearing business attire for Tatsumaki Day, a day when students act as student-teachers to grade school students. Jaucian told Sadsad that the utility man was able to gather at least 25 to 30 bags and torched them. According to Sadsad, Jaucian promised to pay the students.Some of the 15 students who came during the stress debriefing on Monday told DepEd officials that there were laptops, cellular phones, pocket wifi and P2,500 cash inside their burned bags.Possible sanctionsAsked for possible sanctions against the BCA, Sadsad said they're looking into the possibility of revoking only the school's SHS permit, so as not to turn all students into collateral damage should DepEd revoke the school's license and permit.The BCA has been operating for more than 70 years with good standing. But Sadsad said if a prima facie case has been established in their investigation for violation of the Child Protection Policy, they will file criminal charges which are tantamount to the revocation of the school's permit.Similarly, the BCA may no longer be qualified or eligible to be part of the Government's Assistance to Students and Teachers in Private Education, or DepEd's SHS voucher program.Based on DepEd Bicol's record, the BCA is a recipient of the GASTPE program. In fact, in Camarines Sur, the school received the highest allocation from government for school year 2017-2018: P5,936,000 for the SHS voucher program. Education Secretary Leonor Briones directed Sadsad on Monday to check Jaucian's accountability for the incident. She also said Jaucian should go on leave. – Rappler.com",21/08/2018,http://www.rappler.com/nation/210040-deped-bicol-possible-criminal-case-vs-alexander-james-jaucian

These include exercising their regulatory powers like an independent audit into the school’s operations, the limiting of financial assistance to the school, or non-issuance of recommendation for tax exemption.Briones said the annual independent audit is done to review the school’s operations and teachers' compliance with the DepEd’s regulations. The same audit team, she said, can give recommendations for further action and whether or not to suspend or cancel the school’s license.“Pwede naming mag-request tutal ginagawa talaga ng independent body na ito na tinitignan at na-asses ng mga private schools, na sila ang magbigay ng recommendation because usually sila ang nagsasabi ng itong iskuwelahan na ito dahill sila yung nag-iinspect,” Briones said.(We can request, though the independent body already reviews and assesses private schools, that they give a recommendation because they usually tell us about these schools that they inspect.)She added, “Sinsasabihin nila sa amin na pwedeng i-suspend o i-cancel ba ang permit to operate. Pwede ring sasabihin na huwag ibigay yung financial assistance natin.” (They suggest to us to suspend or cancel a permit to operate. They can also recommend to us to not give a school financial assistance.)“Hindi naman sila (schools) binabayaran para mumurahin o para takutin yung mga bata. Hindi iyan kasama sa usapan,” Briones said. (Schools are not paid to curse or scare children. That is not part of the agreement.)The DepEd said it will not hesitate to file sanctions against those who violated the department’s policies.The DepEd assured the public it will fully implement the Child Protection Policy to ensure learners are in school environment that “does not make light of their right, safety, and dignity.” – Rappler.com",20/08/2018,http://www.rappler.com/nation/209971-bicol-central-academy-alexander-james-jaucian-should-go-on-leave

A cooler world: Bicolana teen invents green airconditioner,"Read more
Maria Yzabell Angel Palma has reaped awards and recognition at home and abroad for her eco-friendly AirDisc    TEEN INVENTOR. Angel Palma with her eco-friendly AirDisc. Photos by Rhaydz Barcia/Rappler  LEGAZPI CITY, Philippines – Bicolana teenager Maria Yzabell Angel V. Palma spent two years developing what she hoped would be her contribution to a cooler world: the AirDisc, an airconditioner that doesn't use ozone-depleting coolants.Palma, 19, is the youngest of 6 daughters of Naga-based food entrepreneur Bernardo Palma. She will take up mechanical engineering at the De La Salle University in Taft this coming school year.Palma discovered her AirDisc technology by chance, while working on an eco-friendly oven for a research subject when she was a grade 10 student at the Philippine Science High School (PSHS) Bicol campus. She started working on the AirDisc for a school project when she was in grade 11.Palma completed the prototype that year, and the end product when she was in grade 12. Palma's AirDisc uses low compression and high-volume air molecules to generate cool air in place hydroflourocarbons (HFCs) that contribute to climate change.“Widely used refrigerants are considered as super greenhouse gases since one kilogram of it is roughly as much as 20,000 kilograms of carbon dioxide when global warming potential is taken into account,”  she said.The teenager said airconditioners in the market are based on closed system air conditioning technology that requires a lot of costly power consumption, and also high maintenance expenses. In comparison, the AirDisc has low electricity consumption of 150 watts.Next stepTo protect her invention, Palma, through the help of her father, filed patent applications in the Philippines and in the United States Patent and Trademarks Office (USPTO).Science Secretary Fortunato dela Peña, who was in Bicol recently, said his department will help with Palma's patent application.The next step, of course, is the commercial production of the AirDisc. There are 4 to 5 local firms that have expressed  interest in Palma's invention for commercial development but she declined to identify them. The unit will be sold from P25,000 to P40,000, but once there is more demand, the selling price would go down.“The prototype is now ready for commercial and manufacturing but we’re still open for a joint venture,” Palma said.RecognitionPalma has reaped awards and recognition at home and abroad for her AirDisc.The International Federation of Inventors’ Association (IFIA). recognized the AirDisc, which also won gold medals from the International Intellectual Property Invention, Innovation and Technology Exposition Thailand 2018, World Inventors Contest 2017 in South Korea, and the International Invention Innovation Competition 2017 in Canada.She also received international innovation awards in Malaysia, Poland, China, Thailand, Indonesia, and Romania, and the International Leadership Award from World Invention Intellectual Property Associations (WIIPA and the Best Invention Award from WIIPA.At home, she received the DOST Youth Excellence in Science Award 2018 and is a 2018 Jesse M.

Sarmiento, president of Kusog Bicolandia, officially introduced the group to the public in the 1st Bicol All Media Convergence held at Casablanca Convention Center in Legazpi City.Though its chairman Noel De Luna was not present in the event, the officers across the 6 provinces of Bicol attended the event to formally present themselves to the public.“We are a new political organization but we’re experienced and accomplished men in private and government service pushing for political reform but open for alliances,” Sarmiento said in an interview here.Sarmiento, who served the government in several administrations, said Kusog Bicolandia will scout young members from provinces and cities, and as far as the barangay level.When asked why Kusog Bicolandia is unique as a regional political party, Sarmiento said that the party is new and formed by experienced, accomplished, and hardworking people in various fields of discipline who are pushing for genuine political reform in the region.The party adheres to protecting nature, and believes the patriotic sense of the party is an indispensable requirement for them to serve the common good and the interest of Bicol by endeavouring to be self-reliant.The party also espouses development values, participative governance, and local government autonomy without sacrificing nationalism.""We shall also endeavour to institutionalize political reforms by developing and training potential regional and sectoral leaders, with emphasis on youth, who will nurture Filipino and Bicolano traits, values and morality in public office,” the Kusog Bicolandia president saidMaking up the partyThe organization is a regional political party of Bicolanos whose roots come from the 6 provinces of Bicol, namely Albay, Camarines Sur, Camarines Norte, Sorsogon, Catanduanes, and Masbate, as well as those who may have settled in other places where Bicolano communities flourish.Majority of its members are professionals and businessmen who are looking to radically change the political landscape of the Bicol region.They will be posting local candidates from 6 provinces of the Bicol region in the 2019 polls.De Luna is from Albay and Camarines Sur while his groupmates, lawyers Jorge Sarmiento and Robert Rafael Lucila, are from Catanduanes and Albay, respectively.Sarmiento was a former head of the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (Pagcor), a former Postmaster-General, and a former Undersecretary of the Department of Information and Communication Technology (DICT).Lucila was former deputy executive secretary in Malacanang and is currently the head of the legal department of GMA Network. – Rappler.com",06/08/2018,http://www.rappler.com/nation/208653-kusog-bicolandia-new-regional-political-party-bicol
Naga to equip PUV drivers with first aid skills,"Read more
A new ordinance in this city in the Bicol region will train drivers of jeepneys, trimobiles, padyak, and e-trikes to become first responders during road crashes     NAGA CITY, Philippines – Giving public utility vehicle (PUV) drivers with basic life support training means equipping them as first aid providers. A new ordinance in Naga City, Camarines Sur, will be doing just that.City Ordinance Number 2018-025 requires all drivers of PUVs – jeepneys, trimobiles, padyak, and e-trikes – plying the city roads to undergo the “Driver as First Aider Training” as part of the city’s Basic Life Support Program. This will give them the capacity to serve as first aid providers and make them ready for ""immediate assistance on emergency situations"" arising from road crashes ""while responders and medical personnel are on their way,"" said Councilor Joselito del Rosario, a co-author of the city ordinance. Del Rosario cited a study that shows more than 50% of deaths in road crashes occur within the first few minutes of the incident. If first aid would be given within those crucial moments, up to 85% of those deaths could be prevented. The councilor said many of the victims of road mishaps suffer cardiac arrest. If drivers can do the cardio pulmonary resuscitation or CPR, especially in the first few minutes of cardiac arrest, it can double or triple the patient's chances of surviving.PUV drivers have one concern, though: they'll lost a day's income if they don't work and instead attend the training session, according to youth councilor Allysia Mariefrance Rodriguez.Still, this ordinance is expected to further strengthen the city government's disaster and emergency preparedness program. – Rappler.com  ",01/08/2018,http://www.rappler.com/nation/208579-naga-city-ordinance-equip-public-utility-drivers-first-aid-skills

Father Rex Paul Arjona, executive director of the Diocese of Legazpi's Social Action Center, hits 'how Albayanos have been manipulated... to railroad federalism'    Image based on screenshot from Father Rex Paul Arjona's Facebook account  LEGAZPI CITY, Philippines – The head of the Catholic Church's social action arm in Legazpi City refuted a report that 6,000 Bicolanos pledged to support federalism during a recent convention here.Father Rex Paul Arjona, executive director of the Social Action Center of the Diocese of Legazpi, tagged as ""fake news"" a PTV report titled, ""Over 6k Bicolanos pledge support for federalism."" The Philippine News Agency carried a story with the same title.""Most of those who came did so to listen, not necessarily to show their support. The attendance sheet they signed is evidence of attendance, not support to federalism. However, what is inexcusable is how Albayanos have been manipulated by PTV4 and, to a certain extent, by the organizers, into becoming a tool to railroad federalism,"" Arjona said. Arjona then challenged the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) and the Philippine Information Agency (PIA) in Bicol to clarify this report. ""Otherwise we will consider you part of the Duterte regime's fake news machinery.""Arjona said what happened was like the style of dictator Ferdinand Marcos. ""Parang Marcos lang noon. Tinanong lang ang audience kung sino'ng gusto ng pinamimigay na relief goods. Nang itinaas ang mga kamay, counted na bilang mga boto sa kanilang panukalang Konstitusyon,"" the priest said. (It was like during the time of Marcos. The audience was asked who among them wanted relief goods. When they raised their hands, they were suddenly counted as votes for the proposed Constitution.)Invitation letterThe DILG earlier requested local government units in Bicol, as well as the academe, to attend the federalism convention there. The federalism convention was reportedly set at 2 pm on July 6 at the Albay Astrodome in Legazpi City. One invitation letter seen by Rappler was addressed by DILG regional director Elouisa Pastor to Bicol University president Arnulfo Mascariñas.In this letter, Pastor requested Mascariñas ""to enjoin a minimum of 200 personnel from the academe, composed of teachers and students, to participate in the said event."" Pastor added, ""The participants are advised to be in civilian attire.""Legazpi City was the 3rd destination of the federalism roadshow of the DILG. An estimated 5,000 people attended the afternoon session on Friday, July 6. Aside from local officials and lawmakers, the convention was also attended by public school teachers, students, and members of the academe and the business sector.The convention featured administration resource persons who took turns lauding the Duterte administration and the importance of shifting to federalism.In an interview with Rappler, political science professor Jess Barizo said the shift to federalism should not be done in haste.Referring to federalism, Barizo said that ""anything made in haste without undergoing comprehensive study from the context of nature, effect, and application is bound to fail.""""Furthermore, there's no perfect government.

DILG federalism roadshow's 'surprise' guest in Albay,"Read more
(UPDATED) This official did not only have a video presentation at a federalism convention attended by thousands in Albay, he had his speech read by a fellow Cabinet official too    ROADSHOW. Participants gathered at the Regional Federalism Convention in Legazpi City on July 6, 2018. Photo by Rhaydz Barcia/Rappler  (UPDATED) In events where the Philippine chief executive could not be physically present, he often sends a video message to be played during the program, or a representative, usually a Cabinet official, to read his speech. That is, if he was expected to be there to begin with.So it came as a surprise to many to hear a presidential adviser reading the speech of someone other than President Rodrigo Duterte at the government-organized  Regional Convention for Federalism in Legazpi City on Friday, July 6. The official – whose name was not on the program – also had a video presentation played before thousands of participants, many of whom arrived in chartered buses from all over Albay.The ""surprise"" guest at the convention held in the Albay Astrodome was none other than Special Assistant to the President Christopher “Bong” Go, whose pre-campaign ads on television and radio stations have been airing in Bicol for more than two weeks now.Presidential Adviser for Political Affairs Francis Tolentino, the keynote speaker as indicated in the program, read Go's speech after he delivered his own remarks. Both are said to be gunning for a Senate post in 2019.“Let us all unite until federalism becomes the law of the land. Our fight for federalism is the battle of our time,” Go said in his speech delivered by Tolentino. Interior Assistant Secretary Jonathan Malaya clarified to Rappler on Monday, July 9, that Go was not a surprise guest at the event. He said the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) had tapped Go to be the convention's keynote speaker ""but because of a last-minute conflict with the President’s schedule (he usually accompanies the President), he requested Secretary Francis Tolentino to represent him in the said Convention.""""Please note that Secretary Tolentino was already scheduled to be in Legazpi on that date because of the distribution of LTO license plates and other public activities,"" Malaya said.He added that Go's name was no longer included in the final program ""but it is his right to send someone to read his speech because Secretary Tolentino was simply representing him."" Malaya added that in his opening remarks at the convention, he had already mentioned that Tolentino was there to represent Go.PROGRAM. In the DILG program handed out during the convention, Presidential Political Adviser Francis Tolentino is listed as the keynote speaker (and not as a proxy). Photo by Rhaydz Barcia/Rappler Official government programs usually list the name of the original keynote speaker, and then note the corresponding representative or proxy. Had this been done, would it have stopped people in the audience from wondering why they were suddenly shown Go's video presentation which included a slideshow of his photos with President Rodrigo Duterte in presidential sorties?  Legazpi City was the third destination of the federalism roadshow of the DILG. An estimated 5,000 people attended the afternoon session on Friday. Aside from local officials and lawmakers, the convention was also attended by public school teachers, students, and members of the academe and the business sector.The convention featured administration resource persons who took turns lauding the Duterte administration and the importance of shifting to federalism. There was an open forum during the morning session where 4 members of the Consultative Committee (Con-Com) presented the salient features of the Con-Com's draft constitution, followed by a two-hour  question-and-answer portion particitipated in by members of the audience that included local officials, business leaders, and community organizers.Despite the presentations on federalism and the time set aside for questions from the public on the proposed shift earlier that day, many left with questions still unanswered. Some members of the audience interviewed by Rappler said they did not even know the subject of the convention, and that they were only required to attend it to fill up the venue.Did the participants leave the Albay Astrodome more knowledgeable  or enlightened about the key administration plan? And Go? Perhaps the next Social Weather Stations surveys on federalism and senatorial aspirants can provide the answer.

It also has 1,085 employees, 675 of which are regular employees, while 410 are job order workers.Rivera said they are experiencing congestion due to the hospital's increasing number of patients. Right now, the hospital accommodates about 450 to 500 patients daily. To address the congestion, he said the government is already establishing 4 new buildings for the hospital. Aside from the planned 5-story building, other buildings for dialysis, ER-trauma, and patient support service are also in the pipeline. Construction is also ongoing for other infrastructure such as a heart center (which will be operational by July), a cancer center, and a psychiatric building.

Patunayan mo sa buong mundo na karapat-dapat kang servant. Kasi unfair ka. Nakapaunfair mo (Let's leave together. Prove to the world that you're a worthy servant.

""Mahal na Pangulo, paimbestigahan mo itong chairman. Sobra, sobra (Mr President, have the chairman investigated. He's too much),"" he said, adding that he's ready to show the President text messages he had received to prove his claim.Abrazaldo was apparently sacked  based on an intelligence report on his alleged corruption, that Delgra had received.Delgra had earlier written the President to report that in January, he received a confidential report from the National Intelligence Coordinating Agency (NICA) dated December 19, 2017, pointing to serious allegations of corruption against Abrazaldo.“There were also serious allegations and questionable acts as regional director wherein he acted on a case in which the regional office has no jurisdiction,” Delgra said.The LTFRB chief said that when he received the NICA report, he confronted Abrazaldo but the latter was bent on remaining in his post, prompting Delgra to tell Duterte in his letter, “Mr Abrazaldo was appointed by you, Mr President.” Abrazaldo was named LTFRB Bicol chief in May 2017.Duterte had earlier tagged the LTFRB as one of the country’s most corrupt agencies that needed a major overhaul after key officials and employees were implicated in corruption.Delgra said that 8 LTFRB regional directors had been relieved due to corruption cases involving alleged bribery and illegal transactions.'Support new Bicol chief'NEW BICOL CHIEF.

Roque says Duterte needs more time to win fight vs narco-politics,"Read more
'[In a] scale of 10, the President is only at 6 in his fight against narco-politics,' says Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque    File photos c/o Alecs Ongcal/Rappler; Presidential Photo CAMARINES SUR, Philippines – Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said President Rodrigo Duterte needs more time to win in his fight against narco-politics in the country. ""[In a] scale of 10, the President is only at 6 in his fight against narco-politics. He needs more time to win to reach the scale of 10,"" he told Rappler in an interview at Camarines Sur Polytechnic College in Nabua town.Roque said that the influence of people involved in narco-politics is ""persuasive,"" as they are using money for the upcoming barangay (village) elections. ""Their influence is even persuasive because of their money, that's why we have to buckle up. The fight is far from over, and I would say that because we are on the advantage stage of the war, they will fight back using all the resources that they have,"" he said.He added: ""He's aiming to step down in 2022, that's why we need to support the President at this point.""Roque was in Camarines Sur on Monday, March 19, as guest speaker at the awarding ceremony of Ako Bicol's Ten Outstanding Students of Bicol.The President hopes that narco-politicians will not be elected in the upcoming polls.Earlier, Philippine National Police chief Director General Ronald dela Rosa said the Philippines was heading toward a doomsday scenario without a stronger war on drugs.He said many of the country's politicians won in past elections due to drug money from drug lords.Barangay anti-drug abuse councilIn Bicol, the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) reported that at least 547 out of 3,471 barangays are considered drug-affected villages..But according to Elouisa Pastor, DILG regional director in Bicol, these 547 affected barangays are still considered as ""manageable.""Meanwhile, at least 51 barangays from the provinces of Albay, Catanduanes, Camarines Sur, and Camarines Norte are considered as ""drug-cleared"" areas.DILG statistics also showed that out of the 3,471 barangays, 2,833 (82%) have already set-up their Barangay Anti-Drug Abuse Council (BADAC), while 638 (18%) have failed to do so. Pastor said 638 barangay captains would be charged administratively with simple to gross negligence for their failure to organize a BADAC in their respective areas. The BADAC is in charge of organizing and submitting a monthly report of activities, as well as updating the barangay's drug watchlist.Pastor said they don't see any reason why some barangays can't organize a BADAC when it is part of their mandate as barangay officials.But Pastor admitted that some BADAC members fear for their safety due to possible retaliation from illegal drug syndicates, or groups being tagged as coddlers or in cahoots with illegal drug personalities.Some BADACs are also hampered with operational and organizational issues, such as failure to submit their regular report and the barangay's drug watch list.The top provinces in Bicol with fully organized BADACs are Albay, followed by Camarines Norte. Catanduanes has 91% of its BADACs organized, followed by Camarines Sur (86%), Masbate (52%), and Sorsogon (38%). – Rappler.com",20/03/2018,http://www.rappler.com/nation/198538-roque-duterte-more-time-win-fight-narco-politics

Until the Philippine trench is active, the Mayon will continuously produce and generate new magma,” he added. Laguerta said geodetic engineers from the Phivolcs central office will conduct another round of survey to understand Mayon’s behavior.The volcano has ejected more than 50 million cubic meters of materials since January 13, he said. Evacuation centers are now housing 19,520 families, or 75,325 individuals, from 3 cities and 6 municipalities in Albay: Legazpi, Ligao, Tabaco, Guinobatan, Camalig, Daraga, Sto. Domingo, Bacacay and Malilipot.Longer stay in evacuation centersCedric Daep, chief of Albay Public Safety Emergency and Management Office, said that, since alert level 4 is still up, families may need to stay in evacuation centers for several months, although some evacuees in the 9-km extended danger zone were sent home to prevent disease outbreaks in the evacuation centers.Even if the alert level is lowered to 3, Daep said, evacuees within the 6-7-kilometer danger zone would still need to remain in evacuation camps for safety.“We don’t know how many months the volcano will erupt, but the longest so far was in 1984, when evacuees stayed for 4 months,” Daep said. – Rappler.com ",05/02/2018,http://www.rappler.com/nation/195329-phivolcs-warns-mayon-still-dangerous-far-peak-explosion

Barcia/Rappler    LIGAO CITY, Philippines – Clad in type B uniform and with his electric guitar, Chief Superintendent Antonio Gardiola Jr, the top cop in Bicol, serenaded Mayon evacuees housed temporarily at Ligao Central Elementary School in this city over the weekend.Joined by a band and dance troupe from the Philippine National Police (PNP), Gardiola has been roaming around various evacuation camps for more than a week now to provide entertainment to evacuees through psycho-social care.They performed the ""Budots Pa More"" program – referring to a dance craze on TV – aimed at helping evacuees to cope with boredom and ease their worries.""Moving them away from their comfort zone to congested evacuation camps for temporary shelters is not easy. So we are doing this program to at least make them happy, particularly the children,"" said Gardiola.    Nelia Buema, 74, said she's happy and amazed by the performances of the PNP personnel.""I thought they're just policemen. I'm surprised because they sing well and dance gracefully,"" Buema said. Aside from their prepared song and dance numbers, policemen handed over relief goods to the evacuees of Sitio Buga, Nabunton village, including candies and face masks for the children.  Gardiola said the psychosocial intervention would be done as long as there are evacuees and the volcano is on Alert Level 4.Gardiola added that some of their men were patrolling in ""no man's land"" – or the classified danger zones around Mayon volcano – to prevent residents from venturing back to these areas, as well as watch over the houses there against possible thieves.Aside from psychosocial care, PNP-Bicol has deployed 292 personnel to evacuation centers. Some 900 trainees of the Regional Training Center are also ready for deployment at any time. – Rappler.com",03/02/2018,http://www.rappler.com/nation/195182-in-photos-bicol-top-cop-serenades-mayon-evacuees
Mayon volcano and its remains in memory,"Read more
Kuya was a force of nature, a stratovolcano like Mayon if you will, with his periodic  eruptions    MOUNT MAYON. Mount Mayon spews ash. Photo by Rhaydz B. Barcia/Rappler
 Whenever I see Mayon volcano in the news these days because of its eruption, I don’t just see ashes and smoke compulsively kissing the sky or lava flowing down its slope. I don’t just sense the fear, pain, or panic of its surrounding residents. It also reminds me of my eldest brother.In May of last year, the day after one of my sisters got married in Daet, Camarines Norte, I, together with my eldest brother Kuya Oni, his wife and two kids, and my youngest brother Ronnel went on a journey to transform the Google images in our heads into a real one of Mayon, one of the nominees for the 2008 New 7 Wonders of Nature located in Albay in the Bicol region about 500 kilometers south of Manila.I can still clearly remember how I jumped from one humongous rock to another in my attempt to capture the quintessential shot of its perfect cone as Kazuo Ishiguro’s captivating words in his book, The Remains of the Day, flashed in my memory: “What is pertinent is the calmness of beauty, its sense of restraint. It is as though the land knows of its own beauty, its own greatness, and feels no need to shout it.”It was not a spur-of-the-moment decision but a planned adventure to witness with our own eyes Mayon’s grandiosity.  Spending time with our kuya – an overseas Filipino worker (OFW) in Qatar – is unpredictable.  Sometimes, it would take two or 3 years before we see each other again.“Who would like to join us tomorrow?” Kuya Oni asked the other members of my family. “Let’s finalize it tonight.”“Where are we going?” I asked him with excitement.“To Mayon, Ben,” he answered. “Prepare your things, we’ll leave early in the morning.” “At last, we’ll see the ‘perfect cone’!” I said.This conversation may just be a mundane for you. But not for us.When my father died about a couple of decades ago, Kuya had to mature fast and help my mother in taking care of the family. He was still in college then and I was 9. I was oblivious to the encumbrance that had been swiftly heaped on his shoulders. I thought my father would return someday, that he just had to rest for a while. But after months passed by, little by little, the reality of his death dawned on me.Kuya was a force of nature, a stratovolcano like Mayon if you will, with his periodic eruptions. In his attempt to discipline us, he imposed his own version of martial law at home. Don’t play outside when it’s already dark or when it’s raining. Take a nap in the afternoon after school. Don’t get into a fight with your siblings. No noise or chitchat. Buy me this and that. When I call out your name, run and stand in front of me.When you’re a child and you’re forced to stay inside the house while your playmates are enjoying basketball or you hear them giggling and shouting at the top of their lungs under the pouring rain, you question everything even though you’re frightened. Why is he doing this to us? We didn’t talk that much. He was preoccupied with a lot of things: work, relationship, friends. Looking back, I couldn’t recall a time he divulged his true self or his softer side to me. Rather, there was a wall I couldn’t get through. But as I grew older, I understood why he was like that.He had to project a strong image for us or else we could have broken down. We needed a source of inspiration, courage, and strength and he provided all that. He finished his degree on time and he is continuously developing himself as a professional in a foreign land. In college, he was considered as one of the outstanding students in his electrical engineering class. The back cover of his thesis is scribbled with praises on how well he handled himself with his peers, professors, and yes, even admirers. He achieved a lot despite the financial challenges he had to face.During our trip to Mayon, while driving, he made jokes about the distinct smell which emanated from the rows of carabao poop at the side of the road. Like a TV announcer, he gave a blow-by-blow update on the remaining time before we reached our destination. We screamed when we had a first look of the cone-shaped land formation at the right side of our car as we cruised the highway. But seconds later, to our dismay, the vision disappeared as clouds devoured the volcano.As I held a cup of chili-pili ice cream with the Cagsawa Ruins as my backdrop, I glanced at Kuya. The unfamiliarity and awkwardness forged by his long absence vanished instantaneously. I saw him smile while he carried his daughter and I smiled back at them. It was then that it occurred to me how much he has changed in his ways, actions, and temper. I sensed calmness, peace, and serenity in his eyes. Time and distance indubitably help us transform ourselves for the better.While Mayon continues to spew multi-storey plumes of smoke and ash and hurl pyroclastic material down its slopes, I don’t just see its wrath. What it reminds me more than anything is that one crisp afternoon in May of last year. It was that peculiar, tranquil moment when I, together with my eldest kuya, stared at Mayon with a sense of hope that someday, if given a chance, we’ll go on another adventure together, share stories of triumphs and failures, and invigorate the sleeping strands between us hanging above the vast ocean or the incalculable, free-flowing molten lava. – Rappler.comBenre J.

Photo by Rhaydz Barcia/Rappler LEGAZPI CITY, Philippines –  The Office of Civil Defense (OCD) in Bicol sent home Mayon evacuees in the 9-km extended danger zone to lessen the possibility of an outbreak of sickness occurring in the evacuation camps here.Claudio L. Yucot, OCD regional director, directed the decampment of evacuees inside the evacuation centers residing outside the 8-km extended danger zone based on protocols and alerts from the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) and the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs).“We are ordering the decampment of Mayon evacuees outside the 8-km permanent danger zone to return to their residences because we don’t want them to expose them to diseases. But we will continue to monitor them even after the decampment,” Yucot said.Yucot added the decampment of Mayon evacuees living in 9-kilometer extended danger zone (EDZ) is based on Phivolcs's bulletin guidelines.“All Mayon evacuees outside the 8-kilometer (danger zone) will be sent home tomorrow but in the event that alert level 5 will be raised we will evacuate them,” Yucot said in a press briefing at the hall of the Albay Public Safety and Emergency Management Office (Apsemo) here.Cedric Daep, Apsemo chief, said that the towns of Daraga and Camalig and the two cities of Ligao and Legazpi need to decamp its evacuees outside the 8-kilometer danger zone because there is no danger on lahar and pyroclastic flow.Daep added those residents living in the 6-kilometer to 8-kilometer danger zone in the towns of Camalig and Daraga and cities of Legazpi and Ligao must stay put in the temporary evacuation shelters for safety.“The 7-kilometer to 8-kilometer buffer zone is enough for safety of the people. But we’re reiterating for farmers not to venture within the “no man’s land”,” Daep said.   Currently, there are 21,950 families or 84,415 individuals staying in evacuation shelters, causing illnesses to spread. Children and the elderly are vulnerable to coughs and colds, fever, hypertension, loose bowel movements, and skin diseases.Alert level 4 remains in effect over Mayon volcano. The public is strongly advised to stay away from the 8-kilometer-radius danger zone and to be vigilant against pyroclastic density currents, lahars and sediment-laden stream flows along channels draining the edifice. – Rappler.com",02/02/2018,http://www.rappler.com/nation/195124-mayon-victims-sent-home-prevent-outbreaks

Thousands are already affected and their lives will not be able to return to normal for some time – we need to help them cope with the situation,” DSWD Officer-in-Charge Emmanuel Leyco said. The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) has retained the Alert Level 3 on the Mayon volcano as of posting. This means that the volcano was still in a relatively high level of unrest and hazardous eruption remained a possibility within weeks or even days.On Friday, January 19, lava and pyroclastic flow from the volcano moved 3 kilometers from the crater, halfway to a “no man’s land” area where a handful of farmers till the land for vegetable farming.AffectedBased on the latest report posted by DSWD, the number of affected families has now reached 10,405 families — equivalent to 40,565 individuals — from 39 barangays in 7 municipalities in Albay.Of this number, 6,425 families or 24,337 persons are staying at 27 evacuation centers located around the province. On the other hand, 734 families or 3,119 persons are staying with their relatives and friends.On Saturday, Governor Al Francis Bichara appealed for “augmentation support” from the national government to hasten the delivery of basic needs for those who evacuated due to Mayon. Bichara also slammed the slow release of money from their Quick Response Fund (QRF) which he described instead as a “delayed response fund.” In any case, the DSWD field office said it is ready to provide additional relief assistance to the affected towns.“We still have available stockpiles worth P11.4 million. We also have standby funds, which can be utilized at any given time to provide for the needs of our affected families and population in the mentioned 8 local government units in the province of Albay,” DSWD Assistant Regional Director Arwin Razo said during a press briefing with representatives from the national government and LGUs of Albay at the Philippine Air Force Tactical Operations Group 5 in Legazpi City.Relief aidTo help the provincial government respond to the needs of the evacuees and other affected residents, the DSWD field office earlier sent a total of of 5,500 family food packs (FFPs) and 11,000 malongs for distribution to evacuees, while 500 food packs and 1,000 malongs were delivered to Legazpi City.On Friday morning, 3 trucks carrying 3,400 food packs from the DSWD National Resource Operations Center (NROC) in Pasay City arrived in Albay.
