Naga starts novena for ‘Ina’,"NAGA CITY—The devotion to Our Lady of Peñafrancia, believed to have started in 1710, continues to draw devotees as the nine-day religious fiesta kicked off with the “traslacion” procession here on Friday.

Mayor John Bongat said the city was expecting more than a million devotees to join the novena and other activities from Sept. 8 to 17.

As a yearly occasion, the Peñafrancia fiesta starts with the traslacion or the transfer of the image of “Ina” from the old Peñafrancia shrine to the Metropolitan Naga Cathedral to accommodate devotees.

It is known to be one of the biggest Marian processions in Asia, traditionally and strictly participated in by male devotees called “voyadores.”

Ernie Tatualla, a third year theology student from Virac town in Catanduanes province and a three-time voyador, said his day started at 3 a.m. for the dawn procession.

He said about 30 seminarians joined this year’s traslacion.

At the end of the novena, the image will be taken to its permanent home at the basilica minore in a colorful fluvial procession along Naga River.

SPO2 Tobias Bongon, city police spokesperson, said the Bicol police office sent 1,300 personnel to ensure peace and order during the religious event.

He said the number of peacekeeping forces here could reach 3,000 after the military sent soldiers for the Peñafrancia feast.

NFA halts rice distribution in Bicol markets due to stock shortage,"LEGAZPI CITY – National Food Authority (NFA) Regional Office in Bicol has temporarily suspended the distribution of rice to public markets due to shortage in its buffer stock.

Edna Reyes-De Guzman, NFA Region V assistant regional manager, said they halted rice distribution several days ago.

“As far as NFA rice is concerned, I would like to inform you that for the whole Bicol region what we have in our warehouses is only good for three days,” she said.

Asked why they decided to halt the distribution of rice to public markets, she said: “Our main concern is food security. We are reserving it. Just in case (we) will experience calamity, praying it won’t happen, we have something to give (evacuees) during the conduct of
relief operations.”

She said the daily consumption requirement of Bicolanos is averaging almost 40,000 sacks of rice.

De Guzman admitted that the buffer stock for Bicol is not enough and could only last for three days with about more than 100,000 sacks of rice available.

On the other hand, she said consumers need not worry because the price of NFA rice in the market remains stable. Consumers can also directly buy from their rolling stores positioned at NFA warehouses.

At Legazpi City public market, where NFA rice is no longer displayed, some retailers are affected due to its lack of supply.

Jean Empig, an NFA retailer, said she is hoping that the supply of NFA rice would normalize soon since there are a lot of customers patronizing the NFA rice.

“Many of them are complaining. Maybe because they can’t afford to buy the commercial rice which is quite costly compared to NFA rice,” she said.

Market Administrator Julius Del Rosario said the lack of supply of NFA rice has been observed for almost two months already.

“This problem should be resolved very soon. We pity our consumers who only prefer to buy NFA rice which is the only cheapest one,” he said.",29/06/2017,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/909765/nfa-halts-rice-distribution-in-bicol-markets-due-to-stock-shortage

Comebacking ‘sili’ king and new ‘queen’ shine in Magayon Festival,"LEGAZPI CITY, Albay — For Jomar Balderama and Mary Jane Sorro, the newly crowned “Sili King” and “Sili Queen,” joining the Hot-aw sa Kaonan (chili eating contest) during the “Magayon” Festival meant eating bowls of Bicol Express and Laing made spicier than usual by loads of siling labuyo (chili peppers).

Balderama, who hails from Barangay (village) Tumpa in Camalig town, was also the Sili King in 2012 and 2015.

He said eating and finishing the two bowls of Bicol specialties in just 57 seconds was his fastest time.

“Whenever I join the contest, it really excites me because I would like to test myself if I could bear the hotness of Bicol express and Laing they served,” he said.

The Magayon Festival is a month-long celebration in Albay of its local culture, its way of life and its communities; its natural wonders and tourist spots, especially Mount Mayon; and  its history,
accomplishments and progress as a province.

The sili eating contest spotlights the distinctive spicy cuisine of Albay as part of Bicolandia.

Contestants, divided in the male and female categories, were told to eat and finish two bowls, each containing 250 grams of Bicol express and Laing, without drinking water. The fastest win the title of Sili King and Queen.

Sorro, a resident of Taysan village here and a first timer in the contest, said beating the other nine contenders in the women’s category proved her roots as a Bicolana. Sorro took only a minute and 35 seconds to finish eating the two viands.

“It was very hard chewing and swallowing the food….it is very hot,” she said.

Asked what she would do with the P10,000 cash prize she said she “will buy school supplies for my kids and basic things needed at home.”

Sheree Longaza, event coordinator said the sili eating contest, which started in 1999, was the highlight of the Magayon Festival.

“There were changes in the mechanics in the previous years, contestants were asked to eat pure siling labuyo, but now we converted it into viands but still loaded with siling labuyo,” she said.

She said before they allowed the contestants to join the contest, they check if their blood pressure rates were normal.

A Singaporean tourist called “Jappah” tried the challenge (open category), and found the experience enjoyable.

“My God! The siling labuyo is very spicy! I encourage everybody to take the challenge,” he said.

Dorothy Fernandez-Colle, Albay tourism officer, said the Hot-aw Kaonan contest has been a way to promote authentic Bicol cuisine.",10/06/2017,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/904104/comebacking-sili-king-and-new-queen-shine-in-magayon-festival

LPA  to dampen Holy Week break,"MANILA — A low pressure area east of Mindanao is expected to enter the Philippine area of responsibility on Thursday (Apr. 13) and bring rains in the eastern Visayas and portions of southern Luzon over the weekend.

In a press briefing on Wednesday, the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) said the LPA, that was, as of Wednesday noon, located at 1,415 kilometers east of Mindanao, would make landfall over eastern Visayas by early evening of Saturday, cross the southern Luzon-Visayas area and exit Mindoro by early morning of Monday.

During the weekend, the LPA is expected to dump moderate to ocasionally heavy rains and thunderstorms along its track particularly in the Bicol, Samar and Leyte areas; and bring light to moderate rains and thunderstorms in its peripheries in the rest of southern Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao. Metro Manila may experience light rains starting Sunday afternoon up to Monday morning.

Prior the landfall, the LPA might intensify into a tropical depression packing winds from 45 to 61 kilometers per hour, and would be named “Crising,” said Renito Paciente, PAGASA assistant weather services chief. The LPA, which isn’t packing much water vapor is unlikely to develop into a stronger weather disturbance such as a typhoon, according to Paciente.

Should the LPA develop into a tropical depression, the PAGASA will issue a gale warning prohibiting small sea vessels from taking to sea. This would not affect RORO (roll-on roll-off) services, Paciente said.

The weather and the seas are still expected to be calm until the LPA makes landfall on Saturday. The first effects of the LPA will most likely be felt in the eastern parts of Visayas, Bicol, and Mindanao on Saturday morning.

The last time a tropical cyclone struck during the dry season was in 2014, and it didn’t make landfall, Paciente said. Usually, no tropical cyclones hit the country during April.

“So while we’re on vacation, let’s still be alert,” said Pagasa deputy administrator Landrico Dalida.",12/04/2017,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/888760/lpa-to-dampen-holy-week-break
Death penalty is ‘anti-poor’ – rights group,"LEGAZPI CITY – A militant human rights group in Bicol said the poor would be the target of abuses should the death penalty bill be passed as a law.

Vince Casilihan, Bayan Bicol spokesperson, said the death penalty is not the solution to crime.

“It has been proven in other countries that having death penalty does not serve as deterrence against crime,” he said, adding that the proposed law is anti-poor. “It will only lead to more human rights violations.”

Some individuals who also learned of the news of the House of Representatives approval of the death penalty bill Tuesday also feared that the reimposition of the capital punishment would be abused
by those in power.

Hermes Miraflor, 66, a real estate broker from Daraga town in Albay, said the proposed bill is discriminatory and self-serving since it only favors incumbent lawbreakers “who are themselves plunderers, murderers, rapists or in short criminals planning to save or exclude themselves from this proposed bill.”

Lawyer Jose Leo Vega from Ligao City, Albay said the bill was hastily passed on the 3rd reading.

“The judge will choose the method of execution. It was only limited to drug pushing… other more heinous crime should have been included such as plunder, rape, treason and murder…,” he said.

“…That there is the possibility for that person, as an act of redemption, to demonstrate his worth to society in some meaningful ways eliminates the need for the death penalty. In itself, a sentence of life imprisonment is a fair and universally tolerated maximum penalty for violators of heinous crimes,” Freddie Tesalona, a native of Lubang, Occidental Mindoro and the founder and executive director of Lubang-Looc International based in New York, said.

But there are also those who believe the revival of the death penalty is essential.

Marcial Tuanqui, Director Albay Chamber of Commerce, said the death penalty bill should be approved “as we need such punishment for hardened criminals and to deter others from committing serious
crimes.”

“The essence of the law is in its implementation, strict and serious in a sense. (I’m in) favor of death penalty as long as there will also be a review of the justice system,” said Don Zian Encarnacion, college professor, City of Calapan.",08/03/2017,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/878873/death-penalty-is-anti-poor-rights-group
New road projects to ease travel to southern Luzon,"LUCENA CITY — The construction of a new highway linking Quezon province and the South Luzon Expressway (SLEx) will start this year after the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) completed the acquisition of road right of way, according to Public Works Secretary Mark Villar.

Villar, who attended the ground breaking ceremony for the P230-million underpass along Maharlika Highway here on Tuesday, said the 58-kilometer SLEx Toll Road 4 (TR4) would be connected to another proposed highway.

“The Quezon-Bicol expressway (QuBEx) will soon follow. We will immediately start its construction after we complete the alignment of the route for faster travel,” Villar said.

He said the DPWH was also finalizing the funding for the proposed QuBEx.

“It can be through PPP (Public-Private Partnership) or a foreign-funded loan,” Villar said.

The P13.1 billion SLEx-TR4 project will make travel from Metro Manila to Southern Tagalog provinces, particularly Batangas, Laguna and Quezon, and Bicol region faster and safer.

The four-lane expressway project will cut travel time from Sto. Tomas town in Batangas to Lucena City from four hours to an hour, according to the DPWH.

SLEx-TR4 is divided into five sections: Sto. Tomas to Makban (Makiling-Banahaw area) in Laguna (10.58 km); Makban to San Pablo City (12.2 km); San Pablo City to Tiaong, Quezon (8.1 km); Tiaong to Candelaria, Quezon (14.4 km); and Candelaria to Lucena City (12.3 km).

It will have seven interchanges in Sto. Tomas, Makban, San Pablo, Tiaong, Candelaria, Sariaya and Lucena City.

The project will be undertaken by the South Luzon Tollways Corp., a unit of San Miguel Corp., under the PPP program.

The DPWH is also building an underpass along the Maharlika Highway diversion road in Lucena City to ease traffic flow along the busy Manila-Bicol route.

“With the completion of the underpass, at least 70 percent of the [total number of vehicles using the route] will no longer stop at the intersection and continue their travel unhampered,” said Nestor Cleofas, DPWH Lucena City district engineer.

The underpass will span 419 meters, starting from a section past the Dumacaa Bridge and ending before the approach of the Iyam Bridge.

Buses from the nearby Lucena Grand Terminal, where several local offices of national government agencies are located, contribute to the daily gridlock on the intersection in Barangay Gulang-Gulang. Vehicles going to Tayabas City and Lucban town also pass through this area.

Jeepney driver Rodelio Reyes described the impending construction of the underpass as impyerno papuntang langit (hell that leads to heaven).

He said they expected traffic jams would worsen during the project’s construction. “But after that, I’m sure we will see traffic flow improve along that section,” he said.

Villar said this project was among DPWH’s initiatives to decongest traffic in the country.

“From north to south, the government will be constructing more than 200 diversion roads nationwide,” Villar said.

Cleofas said the first phase of the underpass project, with a budget of P100 million, would be completed in eight months.

“If the remaining P130 million of the project fund will be released immediately, this [underpass] will be finished in the middle of next year,” he said.",23/02/2017,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/874291/new-road-projects-to-ease-travel-to-southern-luzon

Makati gov’t sending P15-M aid to LGUs hit by ‘Nina’,"The Makati City government is extending P15 million in financial assistance to towns in the Bicol and Mimaropa regions hit hard by Typhoon “Nina” (international name: Nock-ten) in late December.

The city’s Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council (DRRMC) approved Resolution No. 2017-01, which appropriated the funds for 27 local government units (LGUs) in the provinces of Quezon, Albay, Camarines Sur, Catanduanes and Marinduque.

The P15 million would be drawn from the city government’s Quick Response Fund.  “I am saddened that our sister localities had endured such a calamity at a time that was supposed to be a season of joy and hope,” Mayor Abigail Binay, the concurrent head of the city DRRMC, said in a statement.

DRRMC officer Richard Raymund said the financial aid is expected to benefit around 14,000 households in the typhoon-ravaged regions, with each local government receiving between P250,000 and P1 million.",15/01/2017,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/862303/makati-govt-sending-p15-m-aid-to-lgus-hit-by-nina
Storm damage delays Bicol rice harvest,"NAGA CITY—Rice harvest has been delayed in the Bicol region after Typhoon “Nina” (international name: Nock-ten) devastated farmlands, leaving more than P5 billion in crop losses, agriculture officials said.

Elena de los Santos, Department of Agriculture (DA) regional executive director, said the provinces of Albay, Catanduanes and Camarines Sur were the hardest hit areas in Bicol, with 86,000 hectares of agricultural areas reporting heavy damage.

Of these, 60,000 ha are in Camarines Sur, she said.

“Fortunately, the typhoon came after farmers harvested rice, so most of the damage [refer to] rice lands in vegetative growth. Many farmers are still setting up their seed beds,” she said.

De los Santos said farmers tilling more than 59,000 ha lost seeds so the government’s rehabilitation efforts would focus on the distribution of planting materials.

She said President Duterte has pledged P100 million for seed rehabilitation in Camarines Sur.

“When the President visited Bicol on Dec. 28, he initially pledged P50 million. But when he saw the extent of damage, he added another P50 million for Camarines Sur alone,” she said.

De los Santos said the typhoon’s impact on agriculture would be felt in the first three months of 2017, largely due to the delayed harvest.

“In replanting, farmers cannot recover 100 percent so the expected harvest in the early part of 2017 would slide down,” she added.

De los Santos said to make up for the impact of the typhoon on rice production, the DA would increase areas that would be planted with hybrid and certified seeds, hoping these would lead to better harvests during the summer months.

De los Santos said Agriculture Secretary Emmanuel Piñol, after seeing the extent of damage in the Bicol region, announced the government’s commitment of P500 million for the rehabilitation of agriculture areas in Bicol damaged by the typhoon.

She said P300 million will come from the Office of the President while  P200 million will come from the quick-response budget of the DA.

She said the DA could determine the duration of the rehabilitation after  a postdisaster needs assessment (PDNA) in  Catanduanes,  Albay and  Camarines Sur.

De los Santos said the PDNA started on Jan. 10 and would be completed by Feb. 3, when the teams are expected to submit the rehabilitation plan.",14/01/2017,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/862095/storm-damage-delays-bicol-rice-harvest

Bulk of Davao aid to ‘Nina’ survivors goes to CamSur,"DAVAO CITY—The city government has earmarked P7.47 million, or a bulk of its P11 million aid to victims of Typhoon “Nina,” (international name: Nock-ten) to the worst hit province of Camarines Sur.

In a special session held last week, the Davao City council also allotted P1.3 million for Albay province, P1.065 million for Catanduanes province and P1.165 million for Calapan City in Oriental Mindoro province.

Vice Mayor Paolo Duterte said the aid would be delivered to the concerned local governments either in cash or check.

The council unanimously approved the resolution that paved the way for Davao to draw the money from its calamity fund so it could extend help to typhoon victims in the Bicol and Southern Tagalog provinces.

This was after Mayor Sara Duterte asked the council to hold a special session to tackle the proposed P11-million “prompt and immediate aid” for typhoon victims.

Vice Mayor Duterte said Davao was in a position to send aid because the city still has unused appropriation from its annual calamity fund.

This is not the first time the city government extended financial aid to calamity-stricken areas outside the city.

In October, the Davao government sent P5 million to areas hit by Typhoon “Lawin” (international name: Haima).

When he was still Davao mayor in 2015, President Duterte also delivered P11 million to local governments in the provinces of Sorsogon and Oriental Mindoro, which were devastated by Typhoon “Nona” (international name: Melor).

The city government also sent P8-million worth of aid to areas devastated by Supertyphoon Yolanda (Haiyan) in 2013; and financial assistance to victims of Typhoon Pablo (Bopha, 2012) and Tropical Storm Sendong (Washi, 2011) in Mindanao.
