De Lima ‘worries’ of ‘sinister’ goals in sending more troops to provinces,"Opposition Senator Leila De Lima on Wednesday raised doubt on the real objective of additional troop deployment to Samar, the Negros Island, and Bicol region, pointing out the move’s timing “being so close to the campaign season.”The detained critic of President Rodrigo Duterte said sending more soldiers those areas on account of “lawless violence” is “highly suspect.”“Although the President has the power to call out the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) in case of lawless violence, the timing of the additional troop deployments being so close to the campaign season worries us that there are sinister motivations behind the President’s move,” De Lima said in a dispatch from Camp Crame.“It might be intended and used for purposes other than its avowed objective. One of them is influencing and controlling the conduct of the election campaign,” she added.
According to De Lima, presence of more soldiers in Samar, the Negros Island, and Bicol region could prevent opposition candidates from reaching certain areas to campaign since the military could restrict access there by merely citing supposed threats from rebels or military operations against “lawless elements.”De Lima said the three provinces covered by Duterte’s Memorandum Order No. 32, especially Bicol Region, are areas where the opposition maintains significant presence.“Curtailing the movement of opposition candidates not only in these areas but in other provinces as well will certainly affect the reach of their campaign and the chances of their candidacy,” the senator said.De Lima further said the military could also restrict the exercise of people’s right to vote, “with the aim of effecting a low voter turn-out in opposition areas.”She expressed hope, however, that the Armed Forces of the Philippines would remain true to its constitutional mandate and not engage in partisan politics.
“The right to suffrage is one of the last remaining basic rights that we still enjoy relatively unimpaired despite the current conditions of political repression and human rights violations under the Duterte regime. We cannot let it suffer the same fate as it is the only remaining voice we have to protest and resist authoritarian rule,” she said.Memorandum Order No. 32 instructs the deployment of additional soldiers and policemen to Samar, Negros Oriental, Negros Occidental, and the Bicol region to “suppress lawless violence and acts of terror” in these areas.READ: Duterte deploys more cops, soldiers to Negros, Samar, BicolThe memorandum also allows intensified intelligence operations, as well as investigation and prosecution of persons or groups behind “acts of lawless violence.”It noted that a “number of sporadic acts of violence have occurred recently” in several provinces. /kga",2018-11-28,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1058006/de-lima-worries-of-sinister-goals-in-sending-more-troops-to-provinces

Leni: Duterte pinning blame for drugs on blind man,"FREE COUNTRY Militant groups rally in Naga City during the State of the Nation Address of President Duterte. —CONTRIBUTED PHOTOPresident Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday insisted that Naga City, the hometown of Vice President Ma. Leonor “Leni” Robredo, is a “hotbed of ‘shabu.’”“I stand by my word that Naga [is] the hotbed of [shabu],” the President said at a speech during the 49th Mandaue City Charter Day.“It’s because the brother-in- law [of Robredo] is the one who brings drugs to Bicol,” Mr. Duterte said.“That’s true,” he added. “Of course, they would deny,” the President said.Robredo, reacting to the President, said Mr. Duterte should devote time to the country’s other pressing problems, too, and not focus solely on drugs.Drug smugglingShe said if Mr. Duterte wanted to devote all his time to his campaign against drugs, he should first zero in on the P6.8-billion worth of shabu (crystal meth) that slipped past the Bureau of Customs in magnetic lifters that were discovered by the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA).Robredo said Mr. Duterte should stop repeating his “recycled rants” against Naga City being a hotbed of shabu.“Perhaps instead of constantly repeating this ridiculous allegation and throwing mud at the name of a city that thrives on good governance and staunchly supports the call to fight illegal drugs, he can turn his attention on the P6.8-billion shabu shipment that slipped past his customs officials,” Robredo said.Blaming a blind manRobredo said it was “ridiculous” for the President to accuse “a blind man” of involvement in drugs, referring to her brother-in-law.“Despite these many problems, the drug war clearly remains highest on the President’s agenda, so much so that he is now pinning blame on a blind man,” she said.The President should have realized by now that he needed to address the more serious problem of rising prices of basic commodities, the Vice President said.“The allegations made by the President are recycled rants conveniently used to deflect attention from the failures of this administration,” Robredo said.“And while he may be intending to flatter me by keeping me at the top of his mind these days when he stands behind the seal of his office, I’d still prefer that he focus on the many important matters that he needs to address,” she said.“Rising prices continue to make life difficult for our fellow Filipinos, especially for those in need,” she said.Mr. Duterte branded a PDEA report on the discovery of shabu in the magnetic lifters as “pure speculation.” —WITH A REPORT FROM MELVIN GASCON",2018-09-01,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1027051/leni-duterte-pinning-blame-for-drugs-on-blind-man

2 suspects in Mayor Bote slay nabbed in Camarines Sur,"Two of the suspected killers of General Tinio town Mayor Ferdinand Bote, were using this Toyota Avanza, when they were arrested in a checkpoint in Barangay Cabasag, Del Gallego, Camarines Sur on Wednesday morning. (Photo from the PNP Highway Patrol Group in Bicol)Published: 11:46 a.m., July 11, 2018 | Updated: 11:02 p.m., July 11, 2018NAGA CITY — Two suspects in the July 3 murder of General Tinio Mayor Ferdinand Bote were arrested by the police in Del Gallego town, Camarines Sur province, on Wednesday morning.Police said Florencio Suarez, 48, and Robert Gumacay, 35, were nabbed after police flagged down their beige Toyota Avanza at a checkpoint on Andaya Highway at Barangay Cabasag at 9:30 a.m.Recovered from the suspect was a caliber .45 pistol, which was seen in plain view during checkpoint, according to police.Del Gallego town is near the boundary of Camarines Sur and Quezon.Insp. Maria Luisa Calubaquib, spokesperson for the Bicol Police Regional Office (Bicol PRO), said the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) in Central Luzon, had alerted the Del Gallego police about the suspects whose vehicle could possibly pass by the town.This prompted the police, the CIDG and the Highway Patrol Group (HPG) to immediately set up a checkpoint.“Ito po yung pinaghihinalaang pumatay kay Mayor Bote pero yung report ho hindi pa kumpleto kasi ongoing pa yung operation…sa spot report lang po ng aming police station,” Chief Supt. Arnel Escobal, director of the Bicol PRO, said in an interview over AM radio station DZMM.Escobal said the suspect is now currently under the custody of the Del Gallego police station.Bote was killed in an ambush in Cabanatuan City last July 3.In Camp Crame, Director General Oscar Albayalde, Philippine National Police chief, said one of the arrested suspects could be the gunman, and the police were looking for “four to five more men” in the killing.These other suspects were involved in “giving [the gunman] refuge, the other the one who possibly hired them, so our persons of interest here are probably six to seven [people],” Albayalde told reporters.He said the police had “physical evidence” in the form of security camera footage as well as witness testimonies linking Suarez and Gumacay to the murder.According to the witness, the gunman approached Bote’s vehicle, then escaped with another suspect on a motorcycle. The two then transferred to a vehicle in a nearby barangay in Cabanatuan City.Albayalde said it was this vehicle that also gave a lead in the case. He did not elaborate.“Most likely, the suspects belong to a gun-for-hire group. That’s why when we were monitoring them, they ran to the place where they were arrested,” he said.The motive of the killing had yet to be established, he said, adding that the police already had “good leads,” including that on the mastermind.Initial reports from the HPG said the Avanza was registered to one Carolina Bartolome of the City of San Jose del Monte in Bulacan province.HPG records showed the car owner requested for a hold-order status on the vehicle in 2012 for unknown reason.Recovered from the vehicle were several firearms, explosives and bags containing money, police said.The suspects were detained at the Del Gallego town jail and would be taken to Camp Crame.In General Tinio, Bote’s family had not issued a statement on the arrest of the
suspects.But Mayor Ferdinand Abesamis of Peñaranda town, Nueva Ecija, the chapter president of the League of Municipalities of the Philippines, said he believed the vehicle driven by the suspects when they were arrested in Camarines Sur was the same one used by a backup team during the attack on Bote in Cabanatuan City.Abesamis said the chapter was also offering a P1-million reward for information that would help arrest Bote’s killers. The Nueva Ecija government earlier offered a P1-million reward.–Reports from Stephanie M. Florida and Mar S.

The police and the Philippine Army also provided free rides.Tricycle drivers in the cities of Legazpi, Ligao and Tabaco continued plying their routes but passengers complained about the high fare.Promises forgotten, brokenRescovilla said that when Mr. Duterte was elected President, his promise to uplift the lives of Filipinos was immediately forgotten and broken.“From the time Mr. Duterte assumed the presidency, we haven’t felt any positive change in our lives. This is contrary to what he promised—a good or better life for Filipinos,” he said.“His promise was ‘tapang at malasakit’ (courage and concern). But all we see now is suffering … the concern is already gone,” Rescovilla added. —REPORTS FROM MAR ARGUELLES AND MICHAEL JAUCIAN",2018-06-26,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1004072/transport-strike-fails-to-cripple-most-of-bicol

PNP records 8 election-related shooting incidents in Bicol,"LEGAZPI CITY—As the Philippine National Police (PNP) in Bicol kept watch over the region while residents cast their votes for the barangay and Sanguniang Kabataan (SK) Monday, records revealed that around eight election-related incidents had already occurred during the weekend.Senior Insp. Maria Luisa Calubaquib, Bicol police spokesperson, said in an interview Sunday that among the provinces in the region, Masbate was put under close police watch due to the rising number of shooting incidents in the area.Masbate had 56 out of 123 shooting incidents in Bicol since January this year, making it the province with the highest number of gun-related violence in the region.Calubaquib also said that the province has the highest recorded election-related incidents.According to police records, six recent shooting incidents in the province are suspected to be election-related. Meanwhile, Camarines Norte and Sorsogon had one each of such election-related shooting incident.Deployment Calubaquib said that aside from the reactivation of the Regional Special Operations Task Force (RSOTF), some 2,000 uniformed personnel were deployed in Masbate as early as March this year in preparation for the May 14 polls.“Our forces are concentrated in Masbate because it’s an island, and sending necessary reinforcements there may not be as convenient as compared to the mainland,” Calubaquib said.Out of 550 barangays in Masbate, 368 are considered Election Watchlist Areas (EWAs) according to data released by the Regional Joint Security Coordinating Council (RJSCC). EWAs are determined by the presence of private armed groups, communist terrorist groups, or the combination of both.“We are hoping for a peaceful and safe election, and to that end, our stations are open 24/7 and our forces are constantly conducting necessary police operations,” Calubaquib said.Omnibus election code violatorsMeanwhile, at least eight individuals were arrested by police over the weekend in Bicol for violations of Omnibus Election Code and by the Philippine Army during encounters with suspected members of the New People’s Army (NPA).Among those arrested were village officials like Francisco Jesus Racaza, a village chief in Placer town, Masbate, who was arrested after allegedly firing at brothers Alfon and Donald Pahilino. Alfon, 36, is a village councilor in Katipunan where Racaza is chief.Encounters with rebels were also recorded in the days leading to Monday’s elections.Col. Ferozaldo Paul Regencia, spokesperson of the Philippine Army’s 9th Infantry Division, said that two soldiers died in a clash with suspected NPAs on Sunday in Ragay town in Camarines Sur.Regencia said that there were two separate encounters in Ragay after residents in the villages told the authorities that the NPAs “have fielded candidates” for the barangay and SK elections. /je",2018-05-14,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/990266/bicol-region-election-related-shooting-barangay-sk-elections-incident-pnp-masbate
Quezon fishers recover P200-M worth of cocaine off Bicol waters ,"Fishermen from Perez, Quezon, retrieved this plastic container thinking it was filled with gasoline. They were surprised to find packs of high-grade cocaine inside. (Photo by DELFIN T. MALLARI JR. / Philippine Daily Inquirer)Published: 9:59 a.m., April 17, 2018 | Updated: 11:03 p.m., April 17, 2018LUCENA CITY — A group of fishermen from Quezon province found a plastic container filled with 28 kilograms of cocaine in the waters off Bicol region on Sunday night, a local official told the Inquirer on Tuesday.Councilor Leonardo Reyes, president of the association of village chiefs in Perez town, Quezon, said four fishermen discovered 28 sealed packs, weighing a kilogram each, when they opened the container they retrieved while fishing in the Pacific Ocean facing mainland Bicol.Police estimated that the packs of cocaine were worth at least P162 million.“When I was informed by the boat owner [about the fishermen’s discovery], I [instructed him] that the recovered items should be immediately surrendered to the police,” Reyes said in a telephone interview.He said laboratory tests done by the police confirmed that the substance was “high-grade” cocaine.Boat captain Edgar Rey said he and his companions initially thought that they found a container of gasoline as their boat passed through the territorial waters of Camarines Norte province.“While we knew that what we found was equivalent to a huge sum of money, our immediate consensus and decision was to surrender it to the police because it was the right thing to do,” Rey said.Senior Supt. Rhoderick Armamento, Quezon police director, thanked the fishermen for turning over the cocaine.“Thousands of lives will be wasted if that bulk falls into the hands of unscrupulous persons,” Armamento said.Chief Insp. Marcelito Platino, Quezon police public information officer, said the police were validating information that other fishermen from Alabat Island, where the towns of Perez, Alabat and Quezon were located, also recovered similar packs of cocaine.He asked fishermen still keeping the cocaine to turn over the contraband to the police.“It would not be easy for them to find buyers. We would confiscate them before they could turn them into cash,” he added.Reyes said the plastic container had 30 sealed packs but the fishermen opened three, suspecting that it contained money.“But they said they threw the packs into the water due to their foul smell,” Reyes said.Authorities here believed that the illegal drugs were part of similar containers of cocaine found in Sorsogon and Isabela provinces early this year.On Jan. 3, a plastic container filled with 24 kg of cocaine was washed ashore at Matnog town in Sorsogon.Police and antinarcotics officials launched an investigation that looked into a foreign cargo vessel, which sank off Northern Samar province on Jan. 2, as a possible source of the illegal drugs.On Feb. 6, cocaine sealed in a blue plastic container was found floating in waters off Divilacan in Isabela. The cocaine, in eight packs, weighed about 19 kg and was worth P80 million.On Feb. 3, a fisherman in Guiuan town, Eastern Samar province, found 25 packs containing substance initially suspected to be cocaine. But tests showed that these contained chloride.Platino said police tasked officials of coastal villages to monitor their waters to prevent smuggling of illegal drugs.Thirty-four of Quezon’s 42 towns are coastal communities—17 along Lamon Bay in the Pacific Ocean, 12 off Tayabas Bay and five along Ragay Gulf.  /cbb /pdi",2018-04-17,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/982913/news-quezon-drugs-cocaine-bicol-pacific-ocean

"Bicol anti-drug drive: P7.7M ‘shabu’ seized, 12 arrested in February","LEGAZPI CITY — Bicol police confiscated at least P7.7 million worth of “shabu” or crystal meth, and arrested 12 alleged drug pushers in separate anti-illegal drugs operations in February, a top official of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) in the region said on Monday.High-value target (HVT) illegal drug pushers were arrested during separate drug buy-bust operations in the month of February, a top official of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) in Bicol said.PDEA Bicol regional director Christian Frivaldo said in an interview that the arrest of the 12 suspects, allegedly included in the “high-value targets” (HVT) watchlist, and confiscation of about 1.2 kilograms of shabu valued at least P7.7 million was a result of an intensified campaign carried out by the agency in Region 5.According to Frivaldo, the suspects were captured during anti-narcotics operations in the provinces of Sorsogon, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, and Albay.In a bid to accelerate the anti-drug campaign in Bicol, Frivaldo said PDEA has created in every province an anti-illegal drug oversight committee in collaboration with the Philippine National Police (PNP).The committee, he noted, regularly checks illegal drug operations in the region specifically the status of narcotics supply and demand reduction campaign.Frivaldo said there was no reported killing of drug users and pushers since PDEA took over the operations of the anti-drug campaign in Bicol.Frivaldo also said that the anti-illegal drug oversight committee plans to clear at least five villages per province in Bicol every month.He even disclosed that at least six villages in Camarines Norte might soon be “cleared” from illegal drugs pending the submission of required documents that would be approved by the committee.“We have forecast of at least five villages per province to be cleared every month depending on the provincial and local government recommendations,” Frivaldo said.According to Frivaldo, declaring a village “cleared” from illegal drugs involves the submission of documents, which would be validated via a set of criteria. After validation the documents will then be submitted to the regional oversight committee for approval.“We cascaded some functions of validations to the provincial committee so they can engage the barangays directly but in cases where irregularities are discovered by the regional committee, this would automatically be grounds for the suspension or revocation of the clearance,” Frivaldo said.   /kga",2018-03-05,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/972971/bicol-anti-drug-drive-p7-7m-shabu-seized-12-arrested-in-february
