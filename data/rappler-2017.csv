Landslide in CamSur causes traffic jams along major highway,"LEGAZPI CITY, Philippines (UPDATED) – More than 200 vehicles heading to Bicol, Visayas and Mindanao were stranded on Wednesday, December 27, in Del Gallego, Camarines Sur, due to a landslide triggered by continuous heavy rain in the area, the Office of Civil Defense (OCD) in Bicol said.

Claudio Yucot, OCD Bicol director, said that a portion of the Rolando Andaya Highway in Barangay Comadaycaday, Del Gallego town in Camarines Sur, was impassable in both directions due to the landslide.

The highway is a major artery connecting Bicol and Southern Luzon, and is used by buses from Manila to Bicol, Visayas, and Mindanao.

Due to the landslide, a heavy traffic jam formed on both directions of the highway in the morning, stranding thousands of travellers going to Manila and Bicol region, as well as those going to the Visayas and Mindanao.

Lucy Castaneda, spokesperson of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) regional office in Bicol, said that a portion of the retaining walls in the area collapsed after the area experienced continuous heavy rains.

Castaneda said said that DPWH personnel immediately conducted clearing operations to ease the burden of the travelers.

“Motorists are encouraged to take alternate route via Sipocot-Daet-Sta Elena and vice versa,” she said.

However, Castaneda also cautioned travelers passing through the alternate route.

“Caution is also advised when driving on this alternate road due to a road slip in Tabugon, Sta. Elena, Camarines Norte,” she added.

The highway was later cleared for vehicular traffic as of 2 pm Wednesday.

Warnings

Meanwhile, OCD-Bicol warned Bicolanos and disaster officials to be on guard and to be ready to evacuate, specifically in areas identified as landslide- and flood-prone, for safety, as heavy rains continue to pound the region.

Mayor Herbie Aguas of Sto. Domingo town also called on barangay officials in landslide-prone areas to be ready and to enforce localized evacuation if need be to prevent any untoward incident due to heavy rains in Albay, which has been going on for a week now.

Aside from the landslide in Camarines Sur, flooding also affected low lying areas in Legazpi City on Wednesday morning, but it subsided before midday.

The National Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council warned on Wednesday that heavy rainfall in Albay, Camarines Sur and Camarines Norte will cause possible floods and landslides.

Moderate to heavy rainfall, meanwhile, is also expected to affect Catanduanes and Sorsogon, as well as in Marinduque in neighboring Mimaropa region.",27/12/2017,https://www.rappler.com/nation/192357-landslide-camarines-sur-highway-traffic-jams
LOOK: Bicol braces for Urduja,"LEGAZPI CITY, Philippines – The Office of Civil Defense (OCD) in Bicol on Friday, December 15, urged the public and disaster responders to brace for Tropical Storm Urduja (Kai-tak).

Claudio Yucot, OCD regional director, ordered disaster responders to prepare for contingency measures to ensure public safety and attain the zero casualty goal of the government.

While Filipinos in other parts of the country prepared for Simbang Gabi, Bicolanos parepared for Urduja, which has stranded close to 5,000 passengers across the Bicol region. Last year, Typhoon Nina hit Albay province on Christmas Day.

Vicente Malaiba, a 51-year-old resident of Barangay Pigcale in this city, tried to fix his home built along the coastal area. He placed small bags of sand on the roof to protect his home from Urduja.

“We will be evacuating to the safer area to ensure that my family is safe but I’m putting up bags of sand on the roof so that it would not be blown away by the wind. Hopefully,” Malaiba said.

Mayor Noel Rosal warned the public to be on heightened alert and be ready for evacuation.

“We will conduct an evacuation probably tomorrow for residents living in the lo- lying areas, specifically in [areas that are] flood prone, lahar prone, and threatened by storm surges,” Rosal said.Mayor Noel Rosal urged the public to be on heightened alert and be ready for evacuation.

Cedric Daep, chief of the Albay Public Safety Emergency Management Office, said that Urduja ""will be bringing in more rain so we might expect for possible lahar flow.""

""It will also trigger landslide and flooding so we need to prepare. Bicol will not be spared from Urduja’s wrath....The problem is Urduja is quite erratic and will be bringing with it moderate to intense rainfall,” Daep said.

He also warned residents living in coastal communities of storm surges ""as high as 3 meters.

""We will impose evacuation if need be. But we will conduct an assessment later this afternoon before enforcing evacuation tomorrow morning. For fishermen, we’re reiterating not to venture to the seas for your safety,” Daep said.

The provinces of Albay, Catanduanes, Camarines Sur, Sorsogon, and Masbate, including Burias and Ticao Islands, had been placed under Storm Signal Number 1. Classes across the Bicol region were suspended.

Bicol’s Aquinas University is now UST-Legazpi,"LEGAZPI CITY, Philippines – The Bicol region's sole Dominican university, Aquinas University of Legazpi, has officially been renamed as University of Santo Tomas-Legazpi, officially integrating with the country's oldest university, the University of Santo Tomas, on Thursday, August 7.

Fr. Ernesto M. Arceo, rector and president of UST-Legazpi, said that it is now the first UST outside Manila.

""The best practices of two institutions will be duplicated to upgrade the quality of education,” he said.

Arceo also said that the integration will allow them to bring in professors from UST Manila, especially for science-related courses.

The 70-year-old institution is the biggest Catholic university in Bicol, offering courses in the fields of law, medical courses, architecture, engineering, accountancy, teacher education and other arts and sciences courses.

Independent

Fr. Herminio Dagohoy, Rector Magnificus of UST Manila, clarified however that UST-Legazpi will remain an independent university and will retain its own board of trustees.

“I will just be an ex-officio member of the Board of Trustees of UST-Legazpi,"" he said.

Dagohoy said that the two universities have already been closely collaborating even before the integration, with UST already supervising some of UST-Legazpi’s master’s programs, including Pharmacy and Law.

“The collaboration will continue and will include other disciplines. It will depend on UST-Legazpi to determine what programs to follow,” he said.

The Aquinas University Hospital will also be renamed as UST-Legazpi Hospital.

""The UST Hospital resident physicians, experts, [and] interns will also be coming in to UST-Legazpi Hospital and vice versa,” Arceo said.

Integration of Dominican schools

The move to rename the region’s Dominican institution was based on a plan to integrate Dominican educational institutions to follow only two “traditions” or educational systems: Santo Tomas and Letran.

Aquinas is just one of the Dominican schools who signed a memorandum of intent (MOI) in December 2014 to ‘integrate’ with University of Santo Tomas. Angelicum College Quezon City and Angelicum School Iloilo will also serve as satellite campuses, bearing the name of UST.

The Angelicum College of Quezon City already signed a memorandum of agreement that would turn it to UST-Angelicum College and installing UST’s rector as the its own rector and chief executive officer.

UST campuses in Laguna and General Santos are also in the pipeline. ",12/12/2017,https://www.rappler.com/nation/191083-aquinas-university-legazpi-university-of-santo-tomas-legazpi
"Bicol grade school students trained in disaster response, resilience","ALBAY, Philippines – The Office of Civil Defense (OCD) in Bicol is teaching the next generation of Bicolanos to be prepared should disaster strike in the region.

Edriel Burac, a student at the Bacacay East Central Elementary School (BECS), along with his classmates, checked on disaster equipment during the static display of government responders here.

Burac said that they’re happy to learn new things regarding disaster risk reduction methods, basic response, and emergency preparedness through the resilience caravan.

At least 1,000 elementary pupils from various public schools in Bicol, specifically in Albay province, joined the resilience caravan spearheaded by OCD-Bicol.

The resilience caravan 2017 is a series of 3 events aiming to educate young people on protective mechanisms and actions available to save lives and protect people’s livelihood during emergencies and disasters.

Retired general Claudio Yucot, the new OCD-Bicol regional director, said that the target participants for the caravan from different schools in Bicol was 800 from grade 4 to 6, but the total number of participants swelled to 1,000.

Yucot said that educating grade school students on disaster risk reduction capability would also help them learn to become resilient in times of natural calamities.

“We want our children to be educated, equipped, ready and resilient for them to know what needs to be done in times of natural disasters even without disaster responders. So in this way, they can pass on their knowledge to the members of the family and save lives,” Yucot said.

He said that disaster readiness should start at home and should be ingrained in every Filipino, particularly the youth.

Bicol is a pilot area for the OCD's ""resilience caravan."" Yucot said that similar events will also be held in Regions 6 (Western Visayas) and 9 (Zamboanga Peninsula) in partnership with OCD regional offices.

He said that resilience starts with awareness on hazards and risks which threaten communities, but people should also learn how to protect themselves from such threats.

This includes information on what to do before, during, and after disaster strikes a community, such basic safety and life-saving response. This information will be shared through creative presentations, exhibits, and demonstrations to promote better understanding, Yucot said.

“At the end of the sessions, we expect that the participants understand the basic concepts of safety and emergency preparedness, know the concepts of giving first aid and other basic response actions thus demonstrate the basic protective measures during earthquakes and fire,” the OCD official said.

The caravan focused on “4K: Kaalaman sa Kahandaaan, Takumbas ay Kaligtasan” to reinforce the message of the National Disaster Resilience Month observance.

Aside from resilience caravan held at the Ibalong Centrum for Recreation in Albay, the OCD is also set to conduct a regionwide earthquake drill on December 15 in consonance with the simultaneous disaster drill in the country.",24/11/2017,https://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/disasters/189382-albay-bicol-grade-schools-training-disaster-resiliency
Old Food and Proud: Balay Cena Una's take on Homegrown Bicol Food,"It's a gloomy day and I am in an ancestral home turned restaurant, surrounded by antiques and collectibles. Though the items in the house fills me with nostalgia, it was the food that would complete my trip down memory lane.

Pabarasugan

What we call ""potluck"" today was called pabarasugan in our generation. At the farm, we would share a meal that we had cooked over a makeshift table. There we would lay layers of whole banana leaves and spread the food all over them.

The ingredients often came from our homes. Of course, we would have gata (coconut milk) and combined it with vegetables or fruits that were in season. During August we would have gulay na santol as it was in season. The oldest in the group would always do the cooking.

Balay Cena Una has the same mantra: it can whip up dishes from what is available from four farms in Albay and sometimes from their backyard.

Tinutungan vs linandag

When the waiter served inalog (roast krill) and I learned that it was linandag (roasted), I couldn't help but wonder how it was different from tinutungan. At home, we would landag (roast) an eggplant, sweet potato and other food either by putting them on hot charcoal or in ashes.

INALOG. Linandag na balaw (roast krill). Photo courtesy of Vynce Opeña

But how about tinutungan? Several restaurants in Bicol, including Balay Cena Una, have this on their menu. I found the answer from Aida Cirujales, a retired Bicolano school teacher and author who is fond of cooking both ways.

According to her, tinutungan used smoked coconut. For example, when cooking pakulaw (any gata-based vegetable dish), hot coconut shell charcoals are put on grated coconut. Then it is pressed for milk. It gave the tinutungan food that smoky smell and flavor.

Why heirloom recipes

The family who owns Balay Cena Una says that family and friends would often come to their home to visit the Shelmed office, which displayed the native home and fashion items that Shelmed created. They would serve homegrown food to their visitors, food which they would use later on in their restaurant.

A local, who was in his senior years, was so surprised that they had gulay na pili (pili meat cooked with coconut milk). In his 60 years, he had not come across this dish until he dined at Balay Cena Una.

""It helps to have cooks with the palate of a Bicolano. It's also our way of supporting Albay [cuisine],"" said restaurant owner, Angel Villanueva.

Gulay na Purupagulong

The restaurant has recently added yet another regional recipe to its menu: gulay na purupagulong (winged bean), as well as ogob (seeded breadfruit), gulay na santol, lubi-lubi (palm-like fig), and sitaw (yardlong beans) as vegetable side dishes. These will be on rotation depending on the season, in addition to pako (fiddlehead fern), iba (bilimbi fruit), tambis (macopa), biriran (starfruit) and pili fruit.

The gulay na purupagulong wasn't supposed to be in their menu at all until chef Sandy Daza visited the restaurant. They noticed during the food preparation that they lacked a Bicol vegetable dish. So they came up with what was available at that time.

The celebrity chef pronounced, ""this is what [the restaurant] should be serving."" He also recreated this dish for his restaurant and is now one of the bestsellers.

The latter is one of the reasons Albay is actively participating in gastronomic events like Madrid Fusion Manila. ""When international chefs recreate our dishes, the world gets to know our food,"" said Albay culinary ambassador Renato Jao during the event, where the restaurant was also a featured participant for this year.

The restaurant is part business, part advocacy. It shares a portion of its profit with farmers and participates in food feeding programs through the Dios Mabalos Foundation. They also recycle kitchen waste through composting. A Japanese expert, albeit one who can speak Bikol fluently – taught them how to do it.

P6-M shabu seized from Africans in Cavite entrapment,"LAGUNA, Philippines – Two alleged members of the African Drug Syndicate (ADS) were arrested by agents of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) during an entrapment operation in Cavite that yielded P6 million worth of methamphetamine drug or shabu were seized early Wednesday morning, November 8.

PDEA Director General Aaron Aquino identified the suspects as Solomon Anochiwa, 34, and Desmond Ozoma, 34, both Nigerian nationals and residents of Parañaque City.

Anochiwa and Ozoma were arrested by joint operatives of the PDEA Bicol and Calabarzon regional offices after they conspired in selling 3 plastic bags containing 1,011.1 grams of shabu worth P6,000,000 to a poseur-buyer along Centennial Road, Kawit, Cavite, at around 12:30 am.

Also seized from the possession of the suspects were one mobile phone and one silver Toyota Altis with plate number YAX-234.

“According to intelligence report, Anochiwa and Ozoma are ADS members operating in the Philippines and are actively engaged in large scale distribution of shabu in Bicol Region, Calabarzon, and National Capital Region (NCR),” Aquino said.

Anochiwa's name and contact numbers were acquired through tactical interviews from arrested drug personalities who identified him as their source, following a buy-bust operation along Almeda Highway, Naga City, last November 4.

“Besides recruiting Filipinos as drug couriers, ADS members like Anochiwa and Ozoma are actively involved in international drug trafficking using our airports and cyber crimes,” the PDEA chief said.

Anochiwa and Ozoma are temporarily under the custody of the PDEA Calabarzon jail facility in Camp Vicente Lim, Calamba City, Laguna. They will be facing charges for violation of Section 5 (Sale of Dangerous Drugs), Article II, of Republic Act 9165 or The Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, before the Provincial Prosecutors Office in Imus, Cavite.",08/11/2017,https://www.rappler.com/nation/187772-shabu-seized-africans-cavite-entrapment

"Bicol lawmaker: P1,000 budget a 'wake-up call' for CHR","MANILA, Philippines – A lawmaker who supports the House decision to give a P1,000 budget to the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) for 2018 said it was a ""wake-up"" call for the constitutional body.

Ako Bicol Representative Christopher Co made the statement in response to public outrage over the House decision.

Asked to comment on criticism that the measly budget was an injustice to the Filipino people, Co said in a text reply to Rappler on Wednesday night, September 13: “Don’t worry, ibabalik lang ‘yan sa Senate. Wake-up call lang ‘yan sa kanila (Don't worry, the Senate will restore it. That is just a wake-up call for them).""

President Rodrigo Duterte and his allies had slammed the CHR and its chairman, Chito Gascon, for criticizing the rising death toll in the administration's war on drugs.

Co did not vote on the motion to give the CHR a P1,000 budget for 2018 but said he supported the decision. He cited the position taken by another congressman, identified by his staff as Pangasinan 2nd District Representative Leopoldo Bataoil, who slammed the CHR for not investigating the killers of elite cops or the SAF 44 in Mamasapano, Maguindanao.

""'When our soldiers and policemen were mutilated, no one among the CHR stood up to investigate the enemies of the state.' That is one of the statements of my fellow congressman. And I'm convinced to vote for it. We have the same reason,"" he said, implying that he would have cast his vote in favor of the motion if he were around.

Co's staff said he was in China when the House vote was made.

Another Ako Bicol representative in the House, Alfredo Garbin, said while he was present during the vote, he did not participate ""as a sign of protest.""

“We want CHR as a constitutional office to fulfill their constitutional mandate in safeguarding human rights for all the Filipino people and checking abuses and violation of due process on the part of the instrumentalities and agents of the government,” Garbin said.

He also expresssed confidence that the proposed P678-million budget of the CHR will be restored in the Senate.

Senators had earlier slammed the House for the decision and vowed to ""fight"" for the CHR's full 2018 budget, even if this lead to a deadlock and government operating on a reenacted budget.

A total of 119 lawmakers supported the motion of SAGIP Representative Rodante Marcoleta for a P1,000 budget for the CHR. Marcoleta had questioned the CHR's supposed failure to ""defend"" the human rights of President Rodrigo Duterte when the New York Times ran an editorial, “Let the World Condemn Duterte,” on April 25, 2017.

Only 32 lawmakers opposed the motion.",14/09/2017,https://www.rappler.com/nation/182131-ako-bicol-christopher-co-chr-budget-wake-up-call
Misibis Bay Resort: A soulful treat with a fresh breeze,"CAGRARAY ISLAND, Philippines – Bring a lot of sunblock. If I can give one tip before arriving on this island, that is it. Although I love going to the beach, I’m not the type of person who likes to spend a lot of time under the sun. I usually only swim when the sun is about to set, and I love to spend the rest of the day relaxing in the shade. This time, I'm going home with a reddish tan but it was worth it.

Misibis Bay Resort is tucked away in Cagraray Island, an hour’s drive away from Legaspi City. Coming from Manila, the flight to Legaspi usually takes an hour. On my first day, I was accompanied by a storm to the resort. My room had a great view of the beach but the sky was dim and the wind danced easily with the branches of the palm trees. When all the curtains of my windows were open, it seemed like I was staring at a mural of a scenic landscape.

 

 

 

 

I have no regrets about staying in on my first day. I enjoyed my room. Since the weather conditions were not ideal for anyone to swim at the beach at the time, I stayed in my room for most of the afternoon.

 

 

 

Breakfast at the resort is a typical buffet. Lunch and dinner however are a la carte. I didn't have to leave the resort and go to Bicol proper to try their famous laing and Bicol express. Here, they have a bento meal with all of Bicol’s famous dishes for P680. Although they said this meal was good for one, it could easily be a sharable meal for two.

Since I was still full from the bento meal, I just ordered their burger for dinner. My server that evening was Mcdonald. No, they didn’t have burgers from the fast food restaurant. Literally, my server for that evening was named Mcdonald, and he was a very funny guy.

 

 

 

Relaxing by the pool was one thing, but I wanted to try out more than that on this trip. Strolling on the beach, I met a lifeguard who offered me an ATV tour of the Cagraray Eco Park for P1,500.

The first attraction my guide took me to was the amphitheater. It had a beautiful view and a structure like an open air auditorium. My guide said this place was even part of the Amazing Race Asia for a season. Anyone can have the amphitheater reserved and it’s not uncommon for couples to have romantic dinners or even marriage proposals here.

Next, we went to the chapel. It sits on top of a hill with a view of the sea. The chapel had a high ceiling, adorned with chandeliers. It was very simple and elegant, perfect for an intimate wedding.

After the chapel, we passed by the zipline and the luge ride but they were not open at that time because of the weather.

 

 

 

Since we had some spare time, we drove around in the ATV. It was my first time to drive one and I really enjoyed it. It made me wish I chose the off-road trail tour instead but seeing the Eco Park was pretty good already.

The next day, I found a friend with whom I could enjoy the day. As if God heard my prayer, my friend invited me to join their off-road ATV drive to the hilltop. I had my heart set on doing water activities but this was the only time I could see Mt. Mayon since the storm finally passed and the sky was clear.

This was when I underestimated the sun. We had such an enjoyable trip up the hill I didn’t even notice how hot my skin had become – but then again, I didn’t care. This was the sort of adventure I was looking for. I felt like Lara Croft racing through the jungle. The guides were amazing and they did not forget to bring a ton of bottled water for us.

We would stop at each point with a view to rest, take photos, and cool down. At the end of the trip we all voted to visit this place called 5 Views. It was called so because it had 5 views of 5 different mountains including, an undisrupted view of Mt. Mayon. Finally! This was what I was waiting for and once we reached the spot, all our effort to get there paid off. 5 Views is right beside the highway of Cagararay Island, so if you want to visit this place, but do not want to ride the ATV, it is possible. It was our lucky day – the sky was clear with only a few clouds and we got to enjoy an amazing view.

After going up the mountain, I really needed to rest. I was tired and my skin was scorched. After a nice bath and before going to bed, I called for an in-room massage which esured that I slept like a baby that night.

The next morning was my last day at the resort. My painful, sunburnt skin made me want to just stay in and wait until checkout time, but my heart still wanted to try out all the other activities. After a ridiculous debate with myself, I got out of bed and walked towards the activity booth. I'm glad I did.

Since the guides, who are also the lifeguards of the resort, and I bonded during the ATV ride, they already knew what I wanted and immediately prepared all the water activities we could try. I had 2 hours left to enjoy before my shuttle to the airport picked me up.

I was surprised by the number of things I was able to do in such a short amount of time. I first tried the paddle board, which is basically something like a huge surfboard and a long paddle. It was a simple, calming activity, perfect because the water was very still. Not long after, my guide and I tried kayaking. This was a pretty good activity if you want to calmly kill time while in the water or talk to a buddy and chill.

 

 

 

 

We also tried jet skiing. I thought that I was going thrillingly fast, but when we switched places and my guide drove, I was almost thrown off my seat! Actually, my whole body lifted off the seat and was flung to the side. Luckily, I was holding on to his vest so I didn’t fall off completely.

The last, and definitely the most memorable and exciting activity, was wakeboarding! This wasn’t my first time wakeboarding but since I never really got enough practice before, I only tried the beginner’s ride. This was my first time trying to wakeboard at a real beach, tied to a jet ski, and doing a water take off. A family who was swimming nearby was intrigued with my whole set up – I could see them closely watching and rooting for me.

The kuyas gave me some tips and reminders and were ready to send me off. By this time, I was already strapped in, and I didn’t have much of a choice. The jet ski took off, pulling the rope that eventually yanked me off the water. Embarrassingly, I fell face-first into the water, with the guys around me laughing. I laughed, too, and was ready to give it another go. The same humiliating fall happened on my next try. Quietly, I promised myself that I would l get the next one right. The gods were in my favor and helped me rise above the water – I was wakeboarding! The feeling was far from the simulated and mechanical – I was really being pulled by a jet ski, dodging waves and was moving at top speeds! I know I was happy with the ATV, but here, well, this was truly exhilirating! The perfect feeling to end a great weekend.

I checked the time, and boy was I late for my flight. I did make it back home, everyone laughing at my crisp, red skin but it was all so worth it – I got to meet the most courteous crew, who became my new friends, and got to check a number of things off my bucket list. This was a trip worth remembering.",30/08/2017,https://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/180602-travel-misibis-bay-resort-vacation-weekend
Soldiers in Bicol raise funds for Marawi evacuees,"LEGAZPI CITY, Philippines – The military in the Bicol region picked up various donations by Bicolanos for Marawi City refugees through house-to-house and store-to-store visits, as well as from local radio stations and other designated stations here.

The collection of assorted relief goods was done for a week, before the military's scheduled trip to Iligan City in Mindanao. The flow of relief goods continued even shortly before the said trip.

On July 7, Army Captain Ronnie Madrinan of the 9th Infantry Division public affairs led the Armed Forces of the Philippines' (AFP) humanitarian team that would bring the relief goods to Marawi.

At least 5 military and government trucks were loaded with 200 sacks of rice, canned goods, noodles, and used clothing, gathered after almost 3 weeks of knocking on the doors of Bicolanos to seek aid for Marawi City, where clashes between government forces and the terrorists Maute Group have lasted more than a month.

The AFP also raised P800,000 solely from the pockets of Bicolanos. This, along with the relief goods, will be handed over by Madrinan to the city social welfare office of Marawi City, which is currently stationed in Iligan City.

Albay Governor Al Francis Bichara and Legazpi City Mayor Noel Rosal also provided P200,000 each for Marawi.

Madrinan left the Tabaco City international seaport and boarded commercial ferryboat Regina Calixta – owned by Catanduanes Governor Joseph Cua – bound for Virac, to get the goods shared by the people of Catanduanes.

The AFP Bicol was given a 50% discount by Regina Calixta management for shipping fees. But from Virac, Madrinan said the transport of the goods to Iligan City will be for free, through a cargo ship also owned by Governor Cua.

'Grateful to Bicolanos'

The AFP Bicol has already been receiving donations from people from all walks of life. For instance, Carlo Lincaso, owner of an ukay-ukay store in Legazpi City and a former cameraman of GMA-7 donated 5 big sacks of used clothing for Marawi refugees. The donation was picked up by Tactical Operations Group 5-Philippine Air Force personnel.

""We're grateful to the Bicolanos because for just less than 3 weeks, we were able to produce P800,000 and assorted relief goods for war-torn stricken city of Marawi. Bicolanos share whatever they can. These goods and money came solely from the Bicolanos, our stakeholders,"" Madrinan said.

On June 19, a simultaneous kick-off ceremony in the 6 provinces of Bicol launched AFP Bicol's ""Pagmakulog sa Sadiring Lahi (Compassion for our Fellowmen)"" project, an initiative to lend a hand to the Marawi evacuees. The launch was led by General Manuelito Orense, commanding officer of the Army's 9th Infantry Division.

The program aims to encourage Bicolanos to give any form of assistance they can, including moral and spiritual support, to boost the morale of the displaced families.

The AFP in Bicol also tapped social media and local radio stations across the region to appeal for help from netizens and listeners.

""We hope that the war in Marawi will be over so that the displaced families can return home,"" Madrinan said. His team will be cruising on the high seas for 3 days before reaching Iligan City.

The Army team is a veteran of humanitarian missions under the Team Albay-Office of Civil Defense (OCD) Bicol, during the term of former Albay governor and current 2nd district congressman Joey Salceda and OCD director Raffy Alejandro.

The AFP in Bicol earlier sent at least 3 battalions to Mindanao before the Marawi City clashes erupted, to go after terrorists sowing fear in various parts of the region.

Since the Marawi siege started on May 23, at least 3 Bicolano Marines and an army soldier have been killed in action. The fallen heroes were given military honors here. ",09/07/2017,https://www.rappler.com/nation/175067-afp-collects-bicolanos-aid-marawi-city
"PH's longest railway to get funding from Japan, possibly China","MANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – The Chinese government is seen to fund the P151-billion, 581-kilometer railway that will connect Laguna to Sorsogon in Bicol, said Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade.

If realized, this would form part of the longest railway project in the country so far. Its first 3 phases, the 107.5-kilometer railway connecting Manila to Clark in Pampanga as well as the 72-kilometer Manila-Laguna commuter line, will be funded by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). (READ: 17 stations of Manila-Clark Railway announced)

The two projects cost P225 billion and P134 billion, respectively.

""We would like to have partnerships with countries using their own technologies. What the economic cluster decided is that the group of Luzon will go to the Japanese government and that the group of Bicol hopefully will go to the Chinese government,"" Tugade told reporters on the sidelines of an event in Manila on Monday, June 26.

""If we put two systems in one place, I will have a problem of mutual relevance and compatibility,"" he added.

Timothy John Batan, Transportation Assistant Secretary for rails, clarified that the third phase of the railway, the Manila-Laguna commuter line, will still be funded by JICA.

The project was initiated under the name North-South Railway Project in 2015, the last full year of the administration of President Benigno Aquino III. It was also during the Aquino administration when the Philippine government and JICA signed a $1.99-billion (P105-billion) loan deal for the line segment that connects Tutuban, Manila, to Malolos, Bulacan.

The P150-billion railway line segment that will connect Malolos, Bulacan, to Clark, Pampanga, will also be funded by JICA, Tugade said.

JICA said that once implemented, this ""could be a game changer in the Philippines' public transport system whose population density is 19,000 people for every one square kilometer,"" which is higher than in Tokyo and most other Asian cities.

South segments

The first two segments, Tutuban-Malolos and Malolos-Clark, will start construction in the last quarter of 2017 and will be completed by the last quarter of 2021.

Meanwhile, the signing of the official development assistance (ODA) for the last two segments – Tutuban-Laguna and Laguna-Batangas-Quezon-Camarines Sur-Albay-Sorsogon – has not been done yet.

""It stands with rhyme and reason that we spread out the market. I want to start activities that are not covered by legal requirements of procurement and bidding; [otherwise] I will lose time,"" Tugade told reporters.

The Department of Transportation said the railway will connect cities, international seaports, and economic zones, allowing for faster movement of passengers and cargo.

The Aquino administration had auctioned off the south line of the project (Manila-Sorsogon). The Duterte administration then decided to continue the segment by financing it through ODA from Japan and China.

""With the government, we can borrow with a lower cost. We don't need return on investment,"" Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno earlier told Rappler. (READ: Duterte gov't calls off auction for South Line of North-South Railway)

Tugade told reporters that the massive Mindanao railway project (MindaRail) might also be funded through ODA from China.

During President Rodrigo Duterte's state visit to China, the Philippine government was able to bring home a $9-billion loan deal from credit facilities to be made available for businesses, development projects, and infrastructure, among others.

Around 17 memoranda of understanding were also signed by Chinese and Philippine firms during the visit. Some Chinese firms involved, however, have questionable track records.",27/06/2017,https://www.rappler.com/business/173975-clark-manila-sorsogon-railway-funding-japan-china-dotr
"Bicol centenarian's secret to longevity: Coconut milk, prayers","SORSOGON, Philippines – The newest member of Bicol's centenarian community says prayers and her preference for coconut milk and local produce are among her secrets to longevity.

Corazon “Lola Ayoy” de los Reyes-Barcia celebrated her milestone with her family in Juban, Sorsogon, on June 18. Her remaining children – 8 of 11 – and their children and grandchildren trooped to their hometown to hold a birthday celebration for the centenarian with the entire village.

Relatives of Lola Ayoy describe her as a housewife who was ""treated like a queen"" by her late husband, farmer Honorato Barcia.

At a hundred years old, Lola Ayoy can still dance. She still has a keen sense of smell and her eyesight is just barely clouded by age. She is not taking any maintenance medicine.

Lola Ayoy can be a poster girl for the benefits of coconut milk and juice – which is the subject of debates in health circles – as these have been part of her diet ever since. (READ: The centenarians of Narvacan)

Asked about the secret of her long life, Lola Ayoy pointed to her healthy lifestyle. She said she ate ""small"" fish, vegetables cooked in coconut milk, local fruits, coconut juice, and the occasional piece of meat. She also cited her daily prayers.

Benefits

The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) Bicol said that the region recorded 171 centenarians.

Among the 6 provinces of Bicol, Albay has the highest number of centenarians with 39, followed by Camarines Sur, 36; Sorsogon, 22; Camarines Norte, 20; and Masbate and Catanduanes, 9 each.

Among the country's regions, Western Visayas has the most number of recorded centenarians, totaling 360 as of early 2017, according to the DSWD.

Like her fellow centenarians, Lola Ayoy will receive a P100,000-cash gift from the government as provided under Republic Act 10868 or the Centenarian Act of 2016. The primary proponent of the measure in the House of Representatives is A Bicolano, Albay First District Representative Edcel Lagman.

Lagman earlier said the measure ""honors aging senior citizens who have served their families, communities and country for the longest period of time.""

The DSWD said 59 Bicol centenarians had received the cash gift from the government. Jesseshan Marbella-Aycocho, DSWD regional information officer in Bicol, said the department was still processing the papers of at least 20 other centenarians.

“Processing depends on the compliance of documents as proof of their age eligibility,” she said.

Arnel Garcia, DSWD regional director in Bicol, said that RA 10868 is a big help to the senior citizens.

Under the law, every Filipino citizen who celebrates his or her 100th birthday shall receive a cash gift of P100,000 from the national government in addition to any cash incentive from the recipient's city or municipality.

"In Bicol, military spearheads relief drive for Marawi","LEGAZPI CITY, Philippines – The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) is knocking on the doors of Bicolanos to gather aid for evacuees affected by the crisis in Marawi City.

Army Colonel Alden Juan Masagca, commanding officer of the Philippine Army's 901st Infantry Brigade, personally appealed over local radio for donations of used clothing, cash, kitchen utensils, food, and school supplies for Marawi evacuees in temporary government shelters.

""To our kababayans (countrymen) in Bicol, we are knocking on your doors to solicit any assistance you can share to our brothers in Marawi City in Mindanao affected by the ongoing conflict,"" he said.

Masagca, who hails from Catanduanes, said the aid would not be for soldiers, but for civilians.

""We might be sleeping soundly here but our brothers in Marawi City are in miserable condition. [Their] houses were destroyed. They don't have a home to return to when the conflict is over. For our soldiers, we are asking for your prayers for their safety fighting against the terrorists,"" Masagca said.

He said they will wait until June 30 to collect assistance from the Bicolanos. The donations will then be sent to Marawi City through the Philippine Air Force, which will distribute it to the evacuees.

On Monday, June 19, the AFP launched the ""Pagmakulog sa Sadiring Lahi (Compassion for our Fellowmen)"" project, an initiative to lend a hand to the evacuees.

The launch was done in Bicol's 6 provinces, appealing for help from everyone willing to send aid to Marawi. Soon after the launch, the AFP in Bicol also tapped social media to appeal for help from netizens.

The Tactical Operations Group 5 of the Philippine Air Force, led by Colonel Rover Sobrino, appealed on its Facebook page for help for the evacuees.

The program aims to encourage Bicolanos to give any form of assistance they can, including moral and spiritual support, to boost the morale of the displaced families.

The AFP in Bicol earlier sent at least 3 battalions to Mindanao before the Marawi City clashes erupted to go after terrorists sowing fear in various parts of the region.

In Masbate City, different stakeholders, including the Muslim community, businesses, students, non-governmental organizations, and government agencies participated in the military's kick-off ceremony.

In Sorsogon, Governor Bobet Lee Rodrigueza invoked the ""bayanihan"" spirit to encourage provincemates to help the affected civilians, and asked for prayers for the military and police fighting in the conflict.

Lawmakers seek House probe into BPI system glitch,"MANILA, Philippines – Three lawmakers filed a resolution urging a House committee to investigate the system glitch of the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI), with bank accounts remaining inaccessible for the 2nd straight day.

AKO Bicol Representatives Rodel Batocabe, Alfredo Garbin Jr, and Christopher Co filed House Resolution (HR) Number 1072 on Thursday, June 8.

They want the House committee on banks and financial intermediaries to conduct an inquiry, in aid of legislation, into the ""security and stability of bank internal systems in light of the recent BPI internal error.""

 
BPI clients began reporting unauthorized transactions in their accounts early Wednesday morning, June 7. The bank attributed the fiasco to an ""internal data processing error"" and said it was not a hacking incident.

BPI executives also assured clients the problem would be resolved on Wednesday. At 10:03 pm, the bank said it had ""rectified the mispostings related to the internal systems problem,"" and that it had also restored automated teller machine (ATM) functionality.

But around 12 hours later, BPI once again deactivated its electronic channels, including its ATMs.

""In the process of rectifying balances of accounts with misposted transactions, we have noted that certain accounts still reflect incorrect balances. To allow us to do the necessary adjustments, we will need to deactivate our electronic channels today,"" the bank said in an advisory posted on Twitter at 10:46 am.

For Batocabe, Garbin, and Co, the banking fiasco ""brought considerable panic resulting to many bewildered depositors going to their BPI branch of account to demand an explanation or a return of their money.""

""We need to conduct an investigation to find out about the root cause of the BPI internal error and to determine the most suitable safeguards and to prevent such future incident from happening not only to BPI but in other banks and financial institutions,"" said the lawmakers.

BPI is owned by local conglomerate Ayala Corporation, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila, and Singapore's GIC Private Ltd.

The Ayala-led bank is the 3rd biggest universal bank in the country in terms of deposits. As of March 2017, its total deposits reached P1.44 trillion and total resources hit P1.73 trillion.

It reported net income of P6.3 billion in the first 3 months of 2017, up 26% from the same period a year ago.

As of end-2016, it has 821 branches across the country, including 35 kiosk branches, and has a network of 3,061 ATMs and cash deposit machines. ",08/06/2017,https://www.rappler.com/nation/172377-lawmakers-seek-house-probe-bpi-system-glitch

Rachelle Miranda, OCD Bicol spokesperson, said all sea transportations were cancelled on Saturday, April 15, as Crising threatened Samar.

“It would be best not to proceed to seaports or your travel destinations as there would be no sea transport unless tropical cylone warning signal (TCWS) and gale warnings are lifted,” Miranda said.

Bicol sculptors connect with God through religious images,"LEGAZPI CITY, Philippines – For several decades now, the father and son tandem of Ramon Arnido Vibar, 62, and his son Michael, 25, have been the most sought-after sculptors in the Bicol region for their exceptional talent in breathing life into pieces of wood.

Their life-size images of Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary, and saints are fixtures in the Good Friday afternoon processions, with the sculptures placed on top of well-lit carriages and followed by hundreds of venerating devotees.

Every day, the two carve images of saints – locally called ""paso"" – for Bicol churches, families and individuals. Most of the images found in Bicol churches wre made in Kriscraft, the art shop that the father-and-son tandem maintains at the back of St. Gregory the Great Cathedral in Barangay Maoyod.

Ramon has been carving life-sized images for over 30 years, having started as his father's assistant. Michael, on the other hand, started practicing the art of cement sculpture at the age of 13, before later shifting to wood carving to help his father.

Family of sculptors

Ramon is the second-generation sculptor in the Vibar family. His father, Castro, was known as the genius sculptor of his time.

Castro was in grade school when he began forming the images of Rizal, Mabini, Bonifacio and other heroes.

His talent was discovered while he was studying in Albay Central Elementaty School in Old Albay District. He indulged in clay molding at that time.

In 1947, during the International Eucharistic Congress, he was accompanied to Manila by a certain Barcena who enrolled him in the fine arts program at the University of Santo Tomas.

His talent was recognized by his professor, Guillermo Tolentino, who taught him not only the theories but also the techniques of modeling and actual practice. The Vibar patriarch was also highly recognized by then Fr. Jose Sanchez, now the cardinal.

In the early 40s, Castro carved the images of St. Peter, St. James and other saints using clay-and-ash combinations. His works are venerated in processions, enshrined in Albay churches. They can also be found at the homes of families who own treasured religious images.

Some of his remarkable works were the images of Msgr. Jorge Barlin in Camarines Sur, which measured 6 feet in height; St. Joseph in Aurora Boulevard, Quezon City (21 ft); Our Lady of the Assumption in Guinobatan, Albay (6 ft); Apparition of the Miraculous Medal in Sucat, Paranaque (8 ft); the Crucifix in the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Gate in Borongan, Samar (9 ft); Mary Magdalene of the Church in Pantal; St. Jude at St. Jude Catholic school in Legazpi City (8 ft); and Christ the Redeemer (6 ft).

God's intercession

Since 1935, the Vibars have made about 1,000 images. Today, Ramon and Michael are famous sculptors in Bicol, known for putting God’s images into wood and cement.

When asked how they can create the beautiful images, Ramon attributed this to God’s intercession.

“Sometimes it appears through a dream. I’m just an instrument of God who has given me this talent to create his images and those of the saints from pieces of wood. Every time I go on with my works, I feel the intercession of God to perfectly create his image according to his likeness,” Ramon said.

Ramon added that creating images of saints, Mary, and Jesus is his way of communicating with God.

This Good Friday, the images made by the Vibars will once again be making the rounds of religious processions for the Holy Week. ",12/04/2017,https://www.rappler.com/nation/special-coverage/weather-alert/221499-tropical-depression-amang-pagasa-forecast-january-21-2019-11am
"Earthquake rocks parts of Bicol, Eastern Visayas","MANILA, Philippines – A magnitude 5.4 earthquake shook parts of Bicol and Eastern Visayas Monday morning, April 10.

This vast, hilly landscape has changed roles over time. Our tour guide told us that fish used to be abundant there, that fisherfolks would preserve fresh catches with salt (buro) before they brought them to the mainland. They needed well-preserved food like binurong fish, as the area is prone to typhoons.

It was once a pasture, too: ""Itong trails na nilalakaran natin, gawa ito ng mga kalabaw (Carabaos made the trails that we are walking on),"" said Kuya Onyong, adding that animals used those natural pools as dipping pools.

Pronounced as Purar-an, this isolated cove in Baras town is famous for surfing. With swells from the Pacific, this is one of the top surfing destinations in the country.

It is also where tourists stay, with several accommodations built beachfront.

Nahulugan Falls and Dororian Falls in Gigmoto are pristine cascades tucked in the island's luscious forest, but are reachable via a bumpy habal-habal or tricycle ride. Nahulugan Falls rarely gets crowded since it is the furthest among 3 waterfalls, while Maribina Falls in Bato is the most accessible.

Based on the map above, there are a lot of these in this province. What you can visit and how many depends on length of stay, vehicle, budget, and the driver's familiarity with those places.

During our experience, our tour guide in Virac was a tricycle driver – Sherwin Vargas (09122602123). We could save time had we toured around via habal-habal, he told us. While he gave us a reasonable deal, he didn't know how to get to some places we wanted to visit (e.g. Mamangal Beach).

But it was all right given the long distance drives we would have had to make from one place to another. So when Kuya Onyong couldn't help it, he tried to kid around with us by asking: ""You two can drive? Go replace me here, and I'll be at the back, riding.""

Still, he was all smiles.

Things to take note

There are no standard rates for travel tours in the province, including via tricycle and habal-habal. Try to ask locals how far your destinations are and how much it would cost to get there.
The local tourism office is at the second floor of the Old Capitol Building in Barangay Santa Elena, Virac.
Summer is the best time to visit. The waves allow for island hopping and sailing at this time of the year.
Solybel Traveler's Lodge is a budget-friendly place to stay in Virac. A P160 per night rate includes a single-bedroom, table, small TV, and fan with common toilets and bathrooms.
Sample the export-quality latik (rice cake with coconut syrup) sold at the market early in the morning. Add biko (sweetened rice cake) and binut-ong (glutinous rice with coconut cream) if you like. Save them for snacks after trekking.
Museuo de Catanduanes houses heritage and culture-related items. Its location is at the second floor of Old Capitol Building in Barangay Santa Elena, Virac.
The PAGASA-DOST Weather Radar Station in Buenavista, Bato also provides a panoramic view of Catanduanes.
There are two ports in Catanduanes: Virac (4 to 5 hours Ro-Ro trip) and San Andres (3 to 4 hours). If by airplane, one airline company flies to Virac from Manila daily (as of April 2017).
Baras is about a one-hour road trip from Virac. To get there, look for UVs bound for Gigmoto outside the Virac port. Contact for reservation: 09305836544
Kuya Onyong is also a certified surfing instructor and first-aider. He's also a caretaker of a two-story beachfront house in Puraran which can accommodate 6 to 7 persons, complete with kitchen and bathrooms. You can contact him through the number 09164653676.
Salve and her husband Rey Cabal, locals who reside across Solybel Traveler's Lodge, helped us find a tricycle driver with a better deal. The first tricycle driver we asked offered a one-way tour for P600. Our P500-roundtrip rate included the following:

Amenia Beach Resort
Twin Rocks Beach Resort
Mamangal Beach (if the driver is familiar with the route)

"#CaramoanMoreChance: Sun, sand, solitude on a budget","MANILA, Philippines – I am not a Boracay person. I love the beach, but Boracay has pretty much become a strip mall on sand. I understand the appeal for party-goers, but my idea of a day on the beach involves far, far less EDM and drunk people.

If you're of the same mind, the Caramoan Islands on the southern end of Camarines Sur in Bicol is a good bet, and cheaper too!

My friends and I decided to go there for a quick weekend reprieve, and the islands did not disappoint. It's no wonder they've become a mainstay venue for the many international iterations of the reality show Survivor; everything is flat-out gorgeous.

BRIGHT AND BLUE. Any water baby would fall in love with this view.  
BRIGHT AND BLUE. Any water baby would fall in love with this view.

Going to and from Caramoan is a bit of a journey if you're from Manila, however, so prepare for a lot of hours in transit, and hopping from one vehicle to another:

The first leg is a 10-hour bus ride from Manila to Naga that costs P700. (If you have cash to spare, take a flight to Legazpi instead to cut on time.)
The next leg is a 2-hour van ride from the shuttle terminal behind SM City Naga to Sabang Port, and that one costs P100.
Afterwards is a 2-hour boat ride from Sabang to the Caramoan Guijalo Port, which costs P120.
Finally, take a 30-minute tricycle ride for about P40 per person to the town proper and the main beach, where you'll kick off your tour of the islands! Phew!
Don't worry; as intimidating as the journey sounds, it's truly worth it once you start hopping from one island to the next. Tip: Schedule your travel so you get to Caramoan proper early morning; that way the whole day can be spent exploring. Renting a 10-person motor boat costs P3,500, so the bigger your group, the better for your budget!

Two of the more popular islands that you should definitely visit are Matukad and Sabitang Laya.

THE HIDDEN LAGOON. The climb up is definitely worth it. 

THE HIDDEN LAGOON. The climb up is definitely worth it.

Besides being a deep stretch of fine sand perfect for tanning and picknicking, Matukad holds an awesome secret: a hidden lagoon home to a pair of mind-bogglingly enormous, ""magic"" bangus. Nobody knows how they got there in the first place, and locals refuse to catch and eat them out of deference.

Catching a glimpse of the lagoon, however, will take some genuine effort. To get there, you have to climb up a wall of rock and petrified coral over 20 feet high. If you're already a rock climber, it should be a piece of cake, but if you don't normally climb for sport, just make your way up slowly but surely. Just think of the gorgeousness you're about to witness and you should be at the top without too much trouble!

SABITANG LAYA. Any castaway would be very lucky to end up on this island.   
SABITANG LAYA. Any castaway would be very lucky to end up on this island.

Sabitang Laya, which in English means ""castaway"" (so cool, I know), is one of the best islands for swimming I've ever been on. The sand is ridiculously fine and feels soft and smooth when barefoot, and stretches far out enough in the sea that you can do some serious swimming.

It also has small coves and formations to explore and that make for great photos. The word ""paradise"" is bandied around a lot, but this place really fits the bill.

PARADISO. If you love to swim, this is the ultimate playground.  
PARADISO. If you love to swim, this is the ultimate playground.

Now, while most tourists rent a room on the main beach and then spend the day island-hopping, our group decided to take things one step further and go camping.

Local government has prohibited camping on most islands as an environmental measure, but there are a few spots where you can still rough it for the night – just make sure you leave the island as it was when you arrived.

You can arrange with the boatmen who took you island-hopping to pick you up the morning after.

TENT CITY. It's not ""roughing it"" when you're on a gorgeous island. 

TENT CITY. It's not ""roughing it"" when you're on a gorgeous island.

In our case, Lahos Island was our home away from home. Lahos also has great sand, but it's a far better camp site than swim site. You can buy a tent fit for two for just P500 online, and then just stock up on water and canned/packaged food – P150 per person should be enough for dinner and breakfast.

We were incredibly lucky that there were no other campers there, and up to now I'm still kind of floored that we had basically owned our island for a night. Just drop all your creature comforts and really soak in the fact that you're on a beautiful patch of sand, surrounded by miles and miles of deep, blue water, with an endless sheet of stars above you.

All in all, Caramoan is proof positive of how gorgeous the Philippines is. It's easy to forget this especially when you live in the metro, and when the more popular beaches are far too crowded and commercialized for you to truly ""get away from it all"".

If the photos above aren't proof enough, here's an awesome glimpse of our trip in video!


No matter how long the journey may be, the effort really pays off, and you'll come home with a great tan, memories of a fun adventure, and a renewed passion for the country's natural beauty.

HIGHLIGHTS: #ClimateActionPH workshop at Power Shift PH summit,"MANILA, Philippines – How can young people lead the campaign to protect the earth from the worst effects of climate change?

Answers to this question and more are being tackled at Power Shift Philippines: Climate Action Summit – a youth camp happening at Patio de Cagsawa in Legazpi, Albay from March 10-12, 2017.

With the aim of teaching youth orgs how to use social media to amplify messages on climate action, MovePH’s #ClimateActionPH workshop took place during the 2nd day of the summit.

Speakers from the Bicol University Student Council, The Climate Reality Project Philippines, Green Peace, Pusyon Kinaiyahan, Oscar M. Lopez Center, Seed4Com, and Rappler held discussions on international and local campaigns on climate change, Cebu’s battle against coal, sustainable energy, good practices on using social media for social action, and platforms for online environmental campaign amplification and community building, among other topics.

This was the 3rd leg of our workshop, after Cebu and Bataan.

Power to the youth

Patrick Anthony Nota, Chairperson and Student Regent of the Bicol University Student Council, told Rappler that the Power Shift Climate Action Summit originated from the Global Power Shift held in Istanbul, Turkey in 2013.

“Power Shift Philippines is part of our continuous effort to promulgate awareness to the students and bridge them to the world with the connections, bonds, and networks they will form. We’re hoping that, by virtue of ripple effect, they will continue our efforts to others,” Nota said.

During this youth camp, delegates from Albay and other parts of the Philippines and Southeast Asia discuss pressing issues on climate action and are trained and inspired to create and mobilize action plans relating to climate action initiatives.",09/03/2017,https://www.rappler.com/brandrap/climateactionph/163737-climateactionph-workshop-albay
"OCD Bicol's 1st lady chief: A tough worker, stickler for rules","LEGAZPI CITY, Philippines – Clad in a dark blue dress, Blanche Gobenciong took the helm of the Office of Civil Defense (OCD) in Bicol as its first female chief.

She is the first woman to head OCD Bicol, which covers the country's most disaster-prone region.

Gobenciong, who headed OCD Negros Island Region prior to her latest assignment, replaced Bernardo Rafaelito Alejandro who served OCD Bicol for 10 years. He was promoted as director of the Planning and Policy Development Division of the OCD-National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC).

In her acceptance speech during the change of command, Gobenciong talked about the challenges of the work ahead.

""Our country, just like the world, is very different now. We face problems that are made of nature, made by human, and nature's reaction to man as well as man's reaction to nature,"" she said.

Gobenciong added: ""Let every worker in our system and in the government be aware of this new face of the challenge and let everyone be ready to carry the burden, meet any hardship, support all efforts to make the Filipino and its communities resilient and self-reliant.""

In gearing up towards a strengthened leadership for a more effective disaster risk reduction management (DRRM) in Bicol, Gobenciong said that she committed and dedicated her service to the country.

 
""Never has there been a time in the history of our country that disaster risk reduction and management was made the centerpiece, if not a major focus, of a development effort,"" the new director of OCD Bicol said.

""Never has there been a time when we finally came to terms with where we are – a disaster-prone area – and what must we really do to address the root cause of poverty and hopelessness among the majority of our countrymen caused by vulnerability to disasters,"" she added.

Gobenciong said that she's a tough worker, and strict with rules and procedures as part of the mandate.

""To those who would make themselves on the other way, I request for cooperation. Let us explore things that unite instead of belaboring what divides. Let us together conquer what will make us fail in our mission of DRRM. Let us respond with the highest standards of service that we can give and what our people deserve,"" she said.

Responding to questions, Gobenciong said that working with men in uniform and disaster responders is not new to her.

""I'm at ease working with them,"" Gobenciong said.",04/03/2017,https://www.rappler.com/nation/163183-first-woman-ocd-bicol-blanche-gobenciong
"In Bicol, indulge in sili ice cream and more spicy sweets","Bicol’s sili (chili) ice cream started as a novelty dessert, with the aim to promote the region. Sweet yet spicy – a weird flavor combo that proved to be a hit with locals and foreigners alike.

During the Madrid Fusion Manila 2016, the ice cream was a hit. “Ang sili ice cream talaga ang binabalik-balikan (It was the sili ice cream that participants and attenders kept coming back for),” recalled chef Andhei Nacion of The Oriental Hotel, which was also a participant together with HML Corporations-Daraga.

The US Navy on board USNS Mercy that visited Albay in June 2016 responded the same. “Nag-order ulit sila kahit namumula na ang mukha at pinagpapawisan pa (They re-ordered even their faces were already red and sweating),” Rowena Aspe, the person behind the ice cream, told us during our November visit at its branch in Ayala Malls-Legazpi. They took some home too, for their fellow personnel, she added.

Today, sili ice cream is a tourism icon for bagging the best panghimagas (dessert) award in the first Choose Philippines Awards held last December, where bloggers, influencers and industry experts nominated, trimmed down, and voted for finalists in different categories together with online users.

It is also a trendsetter in the local food scene. You'll know you're in Bicol because of the following new spicy desserts, drinks, and appetizers from different cafes and restaurants in the region.

Bicol Express Ice Cream

The sili ice cream flavor combination may be weird, but weirder still is chef Benzon Liao's spicy coconut custard ice cream topped with bagoong – fermented shrimp that is used as a condiment in the Philippines. According to him, you may taste the ice cream first, then try it with the cooked bagoong, and then try it with everything, including the panutsa caramel and sauteed pineapple chunks. Overall, it is a clever mix, where pineapple's tangy kick blends well with bagoong and sili.

Lila Restaurante in Polangui Albay, where chef Benzon is the head chef and co-owner, also serves roast squash soup and bamboo shoot salad for appetizers, roast meats and buttered shrimps for meals, and equally inventive drinks. The violet lemonade is a mix of boiled blue-hued flower, lemongrass and honey. A cup of yellow lemon is added to give it the indigo color which the restaurant is named after. Try pandan juice if you prefer something subtle.

Trying the restaurant's “weirder” meals feels like a ritual. You instantly pay respect to the kind of attention and inventiveness given by the chef.

Affogato, the Italian word for drowned, is a simple treat of ice cream and espresso. It may be sweet, but it comes with a punch, making it an ice cream float for adults. The Coffee Table in Naga City tops theirs with crushed pili nut and sili slices.

While locals were not ready for this original concept, keeping the café proved to be a good decision.

Chili Cheesecake

La Comida Linda’s cheesecakes are dense, creamy, and satiny in texture. Its frozen mix of cream cheese and sugar comes with a twist, as it is also spicy.

The owner wanted the menu to be family-style to share home-cooked meals with customers. These include roast chicken, the signature pork bagoong rice, and spicy buttered seafood like crabs, gingered lapu-lapu, and blue marlin steak.

If you fancy a no-rice diet, there's also seafood pizza, kimchi quesadilla, scalloped potatoes, and seafood pasta paired with a crusty baguette, all made in-house.

A café adjacent to the restaurant in Gubat, Sorsogon offers specialty pili caramel cake, chocolate fudge, loaves of bread, and more pastries that can be paired with single-origin coffee from El Salvador, Ethiopia, and Honduras.

Woodstone’s C4 is not a bomb, but it sets your mouth on fire. With Chef Ton’s, chocolate-chili combo, spiciness bursts through the chocolate, triggering an explosion of tastes. Equally addictive is the chili choco coffee cocktail, which is a mix of beer, brandy, Brailey’s, cayenne pepper, and coffee liqueur.

Chef Ton extends this “explosive” feel with his crispy pinangat, crunchy pork cordon bleu, cheese crusted fish fillet, and dinuguan crunchy mix, which uses deep fried pieces of intestine instead of chicharon.

At Woodstone, you can dine in the veranda-type setting, al fresco, or in the comfort of the air-conditioned semi-private room. The bar is open air, and there is also a private karaoke bar.

Chili Mocha

The name sounds familiar, right? 528 Ilawod in Daraga, Albay also has a version of Starbucks' spicy, chocolatey coffee, which wakes up your taste buds and reduces the sweetness. It's worth trying, even for those who are timid when it comes to spicy food, as the café has gotten the blend right.

Ilawod, as locals call it, serves locally produced coffee from the Manobo tribe in Cotabato. As a single-origin coffee shop, it aims to introduce the coffee's distinct taste in every bag. Customers not only become aware of our local coffee beans, but also give our farmers the chance to receive the Cup of Excellence Award.

The cafe has artsy interiors, uses upcycled tables, and is located in a historical place in Albay.

Volcanic Potato

The Oriental Hotel holds a Wednesday dinner buffet with the best of Bicolandia as its theme. What better way to start it than with a spicy appetizer, right? Hence, the volcanic potato, a baked potato wrapped in bacon with creamy coconut filling. When cut in the middle, the spicy melted cheese will burst out, similar to a lava cake.

For signature Bicol dishes with a twist, pinangat prawn and Bicol express pasta are must-tries. The hotel also serves homegrown meals like tinutungang manok (chicken dish cooked in coconut milk and toasted in charcoal), as well as comfort food like binut-ong (glutinous rice with coconut milk) and pansit bato and dried fish in support of local produce.

DepEd: Revive Quick Response Fund for typhoon-hit schools,"MANILA, Philippines – Education Secretary Leonor Briones wants to revive the Quick Response Fund (QRF) of the Department of Education (DepEd) to rebuild or repair schools damaged by Typhoon Nina (Nock-ten) last December.

The fund, which was removed from the DepEd's 2017 budget, was used in the Aquino administration for pre-disaster and post-disaster agency needs, such as prepositioned supplies and construction materials for classrooms.

""The QRF for DepEd has been removed starting FY 2017 and all QRF for FY 2016 have already been utilized,"" said the DepEd in a statement on Friday, January 13.

Heavy damage

Two weeks after Typhoon Nina hit Luzon, the DepEd also announced on Friday that it has distributed over P17 million to more than 1,100 affected schools.

Nina, which left 6 people dead and 19 others missing, damaged a total of 1,046 schools. The DepEd also reported that 1,548 classrooms were totally destroyed and 3,797 others were damaged.

In a Cabinet meeting last Monday, January 9, Briones said P66.78 million had been allotted to build 1,113 temporary learning spaces in 465 schools.

She added that 63,232 school furniture units and 386,689 learning resources were affected, while 384 schools reported damaged computers.

Bicol suffered the worst loss, with 1,237 classrooms totally damaged and 2,948 classrooms partially damaged. Some schools in Calabarzon and Mimaropa also suffered extensive damage.

The DepEd hopes to complete repairs by December of this year.

The agency is also providing new learning materials to affected schools, being distributed in coordination with the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC).

Sustainable preparedness

Briones said long-term solutions are needed to address the perennial threat of typhoons and other natural hazards.

These solutions, she said, include the early allotment of funds for clean-up and temporary learning services, having a buffer stock of furniture and computers, and prespositioning the buffer stocks in disaster-prone areas.

Meanwhile, children's welfare organization UNICEF has pledged to supply tents to serve as temporary classrooms and libraries.

Robredo visits Nina-hit CamSur: 'I wish I was here',"MANILA, Philippines – If she could turn back time, Vice President Leni Robredo would have been in her hometown, Camarines Sur, when Typhoon Nina (Nock-ten) battered the Bicol region during the Christmas break.

""Siguro kung mababalik lang, mas gusto ko na nandito ako. Pero making the best out of the situation, hindi na mababalik, pero bumabawi tayo,"" Robredo said in a chance interview on Tuesday, January 3.

(If we can turn back time, I wish I was here. But making the best out of the situation, we cannot reverse it, but we are making up for it.)

When Nina struck, Robredo was in the US for a family reunion that was planned more than a year ago.

""Nandoon ako na parang ang sama sa loob ko na may nangyayari dito na wala ako. Isang bagay na hindi din ako masaya – siguro marami din tayong ginawa while wala dito, inasikaso ang lahat ng relief, pero iba talaga kasi 'pag ako mismo ang nandito. Parang nandoon ako pero iyong pakiramdam na dapat nandito ka,"" Robredo said.

(I was there but I felt bad that something was happening here and I was not here. One thing that didn't make me happy – even though we provided relief while I was not here, it is really different when I am here.)

Robredo said she was present in all other typhoons that battered her province, except for Nina.

""Actually nasa bakasyon ako pero hindi rin ako makapag-concentrate. Iyong inaasikaso ko iyong relief operations dito,"" she added. (I was on vacation but I was not able to concentrate. I was facilitating the relief operations here.)

The Office of the Vice President, in partnership with non-governmental organization Kaya Natin! Movement for Good Governance, conducted relief operations right after the typhoon. They are currently accepting donations for the victims.

Robredo, who returned home with her 3 daughters and 80-year-old mother, said they had a difficult time finding flights back because it was peak season. The earliest flight they got was December 31, which was 4 days ahead of their previously scheduled flight to the Philippines

""Iyong Christmas season kasi, iyon ang panahon ng reunion ng pamilya ng asawa ko. Noong namatay iyong asawa ko, sunud-sunod, apat namatay sa pamilya namin. Kaya iyon every Christmas season magkakasama kami. Nagkataon lang ngayon na turn ng sister-in-law ko na siya ang magho-host kaya sa US nataon,"" she explained.

(The Christmas season is the time for the reunion of my late husband's family. Ever since he died, 4 people died in our family. So every Christmas season, we are together. It just so happened that it's the turn of my sister in law, who lives in the US, to host us. )

Site inspection

After her arrival, Robredo went to Camarines Sur to inspect the damage caused by Nina in her province. Her first stop was Ocampo town, which is the poorest municipality there.

She noticed that the recovery of Ocampo from the typhoon seems to be slower than usual.

""Sa tingin ko medyo mabagal, mabagal iyong galaw. Halimbawa dito, isang barangay pa lang napupuntahan ko dito, pero iyong reklamo ni Kap, na iyong galing pa lang sa amin na tulong ang dumating,"" she said.

(I think the recovery is slow. For example, in this barangay, the captain's complaint is that only aid from us has reached them.)

""Tingin ko kailangan tulungan kung paano mapapabilis kasi medyo unusual ito na 8 days after, hindi pa nga 50% iyong nababalik na kuryente,"" she added.

(I think we have to help them speed up the recovery because it is unusual that 8 days after, electricity has not been restored in 50% of the area.)

The Vice President is scheduled to visit other Camarines Sur municipalities, as well as Catanduanes, until January 6, to identify other possible forms of assistance to the victims.

Camarines Sur and Catanduanes are two of the municipalities declared under state of calamity in the aftermath of Nina.

"Power restored to 811,000 Nina-hit households","MANILA, Philippines – Power has been restored to more than 811,000 households in the Bicol and Southern Tagalog regions following outages caused by Typhoon Nina (Nock-ten), the National Electrification Administration (NEA) said.

In a statement on Sunday, January 1, the Department of Energy (DOE) quoted a NEA report as saying that ""household restoration stood at 45.95% or a total of 811,327 households served"" as of December 30.

Affected areas in Albay, Sorsogon, and Camarines Sur should also expect improvements in the coming days as the Naga-Daraga and Naga-Pili-Iriga power lines have been restored.

The Tabaco Substation serving Tabaco City in Albay province is ready to receive power, according to the Albay Power and Energy Corporation (APEC).

For Oriental Mindoro, 7 towns are fully re-energized while partial restoration has been effected in the towns of Socorro, Pola, Baco, Calapan, Naujan, and Victoria.

The DOE said that it will deploy more people for a target of 100% restoration before the holidays end.

Relief assistance

The Virac Airport in Catanduanes has also been re-energized and operational since Saturday, December 31.

This will allow relief efforts to reach the hard-hit province.

As of Sunday, aid amounting to P158,282,150* ($3.193 million) has been given to affected families, the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) said in a statement.

DSWD Secretary Judy Taguiwalo reminded the public to inquire with their local goverment units (LGUs) to make sure that aid reaches them.

""DSWD does not have enough manpower to provide the relief goods to the household level. Thus, the family food packs provided by DSWD are with the LGUs. Disaster relief response is primarily the responsibility of the LGUs, with the DSWD ready to augment their resources,” Taguiwalo said.

DSWD is still preparing its response to shelter needs of affected residents. Over 239,000 homes were damaged by the typhoon, and 46,850 familes remain in evacuation centers as of Sunday.",01/01/2017,https://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/disasters/157147-typhoon-nina-energy-restored-dswd-aid
