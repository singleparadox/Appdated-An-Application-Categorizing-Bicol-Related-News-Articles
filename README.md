# Appdated An Application Categorizing Bicol Related News Articles

This application identifies topics in Bicol-related news articles through the use of generated clustered models.

# External Libraries Used:
1. Beautiful Soup 4
2. Scikit-learn
3. matplotlib
4. pandas
5. NumPy
6. requests

# Main Algorithms Used
* ##### TFIDF
* #####  K-Means++

# Purpose of the Algorithms
##### 1. **TFIDF**:

This algorithm is used to process textual data to numerical data as the Scikit-Learn library only accepts numerical data as a model.


##### 2. **K-Means++:** 
This algorithm is responsible for clustering the data generated by the TFIDF algorithm. The main reason on why we used clustering instead of a classifier is that we do not know what exactly is in the data.
