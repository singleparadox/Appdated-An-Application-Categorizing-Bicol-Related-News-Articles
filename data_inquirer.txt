Mt. Mayon spews 300-meter high ash plume;In this January 22, 2018 photo, Mt. Mayon spews column of ash into the sky about 10 kilometers in height around 12: 45 p.m. raising its alert level from 3 to 4. The Ashfall will hit the towns of Guinobatan, Oas, Polangui, Libon and Ligao City. Photo by Michael Jaucian / Inquirer Southern LuzonLEGAZPI CITY – Mayon Volcano had another steam-driven or “phreatic” eruption, spewing grayish ash plume 300 meters high from the summit on Friday morning, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said.The event, already the second time this week, was observed around 6:27 a.m. and followed a similar eruption on Thursday morning.Friday’s phreatic eruption sent into the air a grayish ash plume that drifted southwest towards the towns of Camalig and Guinobatan, according to Phivolcs Senior Science Research Specialist Paul Alanis.“It (phreatic eruption) is just a normal occurrence, signs that signify the volcano is still restive,” he said.Alanis explained that the two steam-driven explosions were triggered by the volcano’s natural “degassing process.”Phivolcs seismic monitoring network for the past 24-hours has recorded six volcanic earthquakes and two rock-fall events. Two of the earthquakes were related to the steam-driven explosion that occurred Thursday and Friday, respectively.Phivolcs said fair crater glow continued to be observed at night while sulfur gas emission was measured at 988 tons per day.Alert level 2 remains hoisted over Mayon Volcano. This means the volcano continues at a moderate level of unrest.Phivolcs reiterated its warning to villagers not to enter the six-kilometer danger zone (6-km PDZ) and a precautionary seven-kilometer radius extended danger zone (EDZ) stretching from the Anoling, Camalig to Sta. Misericordia, Sto. Domingo.Civil aviation authorities must advise pilots to avoid flying close to the volcano’s summit as airborne ash and ballistic fragments from sudden explosions may pose hazards to aircraft, Phivolcs said. /kga30 more evacuation centers to rise in Bicol;TEMPORARY SHELTER Residents fleeing their villages during the eruption of Mayon volcano in Albay province in 2018 seek temporary shelter at Bitano Elementary School in Legazpi City. -MARK ALVIC ESPLANAPresident Duterte has given the go signal for the construction of more than 30 evacuation centers in six provinces in Bicol, two months after the region was hit by Typhoon “Usman” in late December.Presidential spokesperson Salvador Panelo said Duterte approved the projects during a Cabinet meeting on Monday night.Decent placeDuring his inspection of areas affected by Usman in Pili town, Camarines Sur, in January, Duterte said he would use the multibillion-peso road users’ tax to fund flood control and disaster rehabilitation projects for Bicol.He also said he would build more evacuation centers in disaster-prone areas “so that displaced families would have a decent place to stay.”He noted that the use of classrooms and school buildings as evacuation centers had often interrupted the education of students.Local officials thanked Duterte for his plan to build more evacuation centers in Bicol.Governors Al Francis Bichara of Albay and Miguel Villafuerte of Camarines Sur said the President had always kept his promises.Villafuerte said 14 evacuation centers would be built this year in Camarines Sur.In Masbate, Vice Gov.
